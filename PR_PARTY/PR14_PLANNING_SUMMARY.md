## What We're Building

### 4 Core Features

| Feature | Time | Priority | Impact |
|---------|------|----------|--------|
| Drag State Management | 1.5h | HIGH | Foundation for all drag operations |
| HTML5 Drag & Drop Integration | 2h | HIGH | Core drag and drop functionality |
| Snap-to-Clip Logic | 1.5h | MEDIUM | Professional editing precision |
| Visual Feedback & Polish | 1h | LOW | Enhanced user experience |

**Total Time:** 4-6 hours

---

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: HTML5 Drag & Drop API
**Choice:** Use native HTML5 Drag & Drop API  
**Rationale:**
- Built-in accessibility support
- Standard behavior users expect
- No additional dependencies
- Cross-platform consistency

**Impact:** Ensures professional accessibility and reduces implementation complexity

### Decision 2: Time-Based Snap Threshold
**Choice:** 0.5 second snap threshold  
**Rationale:**
- Works consistently across all zoom levels
- Professional video editor standard
- Precise time-based alignment
- Matches industry expectations

**Impact:** Provides professional editing precision that works at any zoom level

### Decision 3: Overlap Prevention
**Choice:** Prevent overlaps entirely  
**Rationale:**
- Keeps timeline clean and professional
- Simpler state management
- Clear visual feedback
- Matches professional editor behavior

**Impact:** Ensures clean timeline layout and intuitive user experience

### Decision 4: Context API Integration
**Choice:** Integrate with existing TimelineContext  
**Rationale:**
- Consistent with PR#11 architecture
- Centralized drag state management
- Easy integration with timeline state
- Follows established patterns

**Impact:** Maintains architectural consistency and enables seamless integration

## Implementation Strategy

### Timeline
```
Phase 1 (1.5h): Drag State Foundation
├─ Add drag state to TimelineContext
├─ Create drag state management methods
└─ Update useTimeline hook

Phase 2 (2h): HTML5 Drag & Drop Integration
├─ Create useDragDrop hook
├─ Update Clip component (draggable)
└─ Update Track component (drop zones)

Phase 3 (1.5h): Snap-to-Clip Logic
├─ Implement snap detection
└─ Add visual snap indicators

Phase 4 (1h): Visual Feedback & Polish
├─ Add drag preview
└─ Add smooth animations
```

### Key Principle
**Test after EACH phase** - Verify functionality before moving to next phase

---

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- [ ] Drag operation: < 16ms response time
- [ ] Snap calculation: < 5ms
- [ ] State update: < 10ms
- [ ] Zero critical bugs

### Qualitative
- [ ] Drag and drop feels professional
- [ ] Snap-to-clip works intuitively
- [ ] Visual feedback is clear
- [ ] Users say "This feels like a real video editor!"

## Risks Identified & Mitigated

### Risk 1: HTML5 Drag & Drop Browser Quirks 🟡 MEDIUM
**Issue:** Different browsers may handle drag events differently  
**Mitigation:** Test on multiple browsers, implement fallbacks  
**Status:** Documented

### Risk 2: Performance with Many Clips 🟢 LOW
**Issue:** Snap calculations could slow down with many clips  
**Mitigation:** Optimize snap calculations, limit snap targets  
**Status:** Mitigated

### Risk 3: State Management Complexity 🟡 MEDIUM
**Issue:** Drag state could become complex  
**Mitigation:** Keep drag state simple, clear separation  
**Status:** Documented

### Risk 4: Accessibility Implementation 🟢 LOW
**Issue:** Drag and drop accessibility could be challenging  
**Mitigation:** Use HTML5 API, test with screen readers  
**Status:** Mitigated

**Overall Risk:** LOW - Well-understood technology with clear implementation path

## Hot Tips

### Tip 1: Start with Basic Drag and Drop
**Why:** Get the core functionality working before adding snap-to-clip. This ensures the foundation is solid.

### Tip 2: Test Snap Threshold Early
**Why:** The 0.5 second threshold might need adjustment based on user testing. Test this early to avoid rework.

### Tip 3: Use Visual Feedback Liberally
**Why:** Drag and drop without visual feedback feels broken. Users need to see what's happening during drag operations.

### Tip 4: Commit After Each Phase
**Why:** Drag and drop can be tricky to debug. Committing after each phase ensures you can rollback if needed.

## Go / No-Go Decision

### Go If:
- ✅ PR #11, #12, #13 complete
- ✅ Have 4+ hours available
- ✅ Excited about professional video editor features
- ✅ Want ClipForge to feel like a real video editor

### No-Go If:
- ❌ Prerequisites not complete
- ❌ Time-constrained (<4 hours)
- ❌ Other priorities (critical bugs, essential features)
- ❌ Not interested in drag-and-drop functionality

**Decision Aid:** This is a core professional video editor feature. If you want ClipForge to rival professional editors, this is essential. If you're focused on basic functionality, consider deferring.

## Immediate Next Actions

### Pre-Flight (5 minutes)
- [ ] Prerequisites checked (PR #11, #12, #13 complete)
- [ ] Timeline working with multiple tracks
- [ ] Test clips imported and visible
- [ ] Branch created: `feature/pr14-drag-drop-clips`

### Day 1 Goals (4-6 hours)
- [ ] Read full specification (45 min)
- [ ] Set up environment (15 min)
- [ ] Start Phase 1: Drag State Foundation (1.5h)
- [ ] Complete Phase 2: HTML5 Drag & Drop (2h)
- [ ] Complete Phase 3: Snap-to-Clip Logic (1.5h)
- [ ] Complete Phase 4: Visual Feedback (1h)

**Checkpoint:** Drag and drop working between tracks with snap functionality

---

## Conclusion

**Planning Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Confidence Level:** HIGH  
**Recommendation:** Build it! This is essential for professional video editor experience

**Next Step:** When ready, start with Phase 1: Drag State Foundation.

---

**You've got this!** 💪

ClipForge already has a professional timeline with multi-track support. Adding drag-and-drop functionality will transform it from a static editor into an interactive, professional video editing experience. The HTML5 Drag & Drop API provides excellent accessibility support, and the snap-to-clip functionality will make precise editing effortless.

Once this is complete, ClipForge will rival professional video editing software in terms of user experience. This is the feature that makes users say "Wow, this feels like a real video editor!"
