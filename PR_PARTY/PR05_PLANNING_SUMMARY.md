## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: CSS-Based Blocks Over Canvas
**Choice:** Use divs with calculated widths, not canvas rendering  
**Rationale:** Faster to implement, React-friendly, flexible styling  
**Impact:** Quicker MVP delivery, easier to modify later

### Decision 2: Duration-Based Proportional Widths
**Choice:** Calculate clip width based on duration relative to total  
**Rationale:** Professional standard, intuitive for users  
**Impact:** Clips accurately represent their actual length in project

### Decision 3: App-Level Selection State
**Choice:** Lift selectedClipId to App.js, not local Timeline state  
**Rationale:** Single source of truth, needed by Timeline + Player  
**Impact:** Predictable data flow, easier debugging

### Decision 4: Auto-Select First Clip
**Choice:** Automatically select first imported clip  
**Rationale:** Better UX, shows immediate connection to player  
**Impact:** Users can start editing immediately after import

### Decision 5: Horizontal Scroll for Long Timelines
**Choice:** Accept horizontal scrolling for MVP, add zoom post-MVP  
**Rationale:** Reduces complexity, common pattern in editors  
**Impact:** Long timelines scrollable but usable

## Implementation Strategy

### Timeline Breakdown
```
Hour 1: Component Structure & Clip Display
├─ Create Timeline.js component (30 min)
├─ Create Timeline.css styling (30 min)
└─ Display clips with proportional widths (Start)

Hour 2: Clip Display & Empty State
├─ Complete clip display with names/durations (30 min)
├─ Calculate total duration for metadata (15 min)
└─ Empty state implementation (15 min)

Hour 3: Selection & Interaction
├─ Add selection state to App.js (30 min)
├─ Implement click handlers (15 min)
├─ Visual highlight for selection (15 min)
└─ Connect to VideoPlayer (Start)

Hour 4: Integration & Polish
├─ Complete player integration (15 min)
├─ Testing and bug fixes (30 min)
├─ Polish & responsive design (15 min)
└─ Documentation & cleanup (15 min)
```

### Key Principle
**Test as you build** - Don't wait until the end to verify integration with player

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Selection must update player** - Core workflow connection
2. **Width calculation must be accurate** - Builds user trust
3. **Empty state must be helpful** - Guides user action
4. **Visual feedback must be clear** - Shows what's selected

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- [ ] Timeline displays all imported clips
- [ ] Clip widths are proportional to duration (±5% accuracy)
- [ ] Selection updates in <100ms
- [ ] Timeline updates on import in <200ms
- [ ] Works with 1-10 clips

### Qualitative
- [ ] Users can immediately understand timeline layout
- [ ] Selection highlight is obvious and clear
- [ ] Empty state guides user to next action
- [ ] Timeline feels professional and polished
- [ ] Integration with player feels seamless

## Risks Identified & Mitigated

### Risk 1: Clip Width Calculation Issues 🟡 MEDIUM
**Issue:** Proportional widths might be wrong or cause layout issues  
**Mitigation:** Test with varying clip durations, handle edge cases  
**Status:** Documented in checklist, will test thoroughly

### Risk 2: Selection Not Updating Player 🔴 HIGH
**Issue:** Timeline and VideoPlayer may not communicate correctly  
**Mitigation:** Test integration after every change, use React DevTools  
**Status:** High priority testing checkpoint

### Risk 3: Very Long Timeline Beyond Viewport 🟡 MEDIUM
**Issue:** Long videos might extend beyond screen  
**Mitigation:** Accept horizontal scroll for MVP, add zoom post-MVP  
**Status:** Acceptable limitation for MVP

### Risk 4: Integration Issues with Existing Components 🔴 HIGH
**Issue:** Works with App.js and VideoPlayer from PR #2 and #3  
**Mitigation:** Coordinate with those PRs, test with mock data first  
**Status:** Must verify dependencies complete before starting

### Risk 5: Empty State Not Visible 🟢 LOW
**Issue:** Users might not see empty state message  
**Mitigation:** Clear visual design with icon and helpful text  
**Status:** Low risk, polish focused

**Overall Risk:** MEDIUM - Core functionality well-defined, integration needs careful testing

## Hot Tips

### Tip 1: Test Width Calculation Early
**Why:** Width calculation bugs are easy to catch but annoying to fix late in development  
**How:** Test with mock data first, verify proportions visually

### Tip 2: Use React DevTools
**Why:** Seeing state updates in real-time helps debug selection issues  
**How:** Keep DevTools open, watch selectedClipId change on clicks

### Tip 3: Start Simple, Add Complexity
**Why:** Get basic display working before adding selection, then add interactions  
**How:** Phase-based approach in checklist guides you

### Tip 4: Visual Testing is Key
**Why:** Timeline is a visual component - seeing it matters more than logic  
**How:** Test with varied clip durations, many clips, empty state

### Tip 5: Don't Skip Empty State
**Why:** First impression matters, and empty state is the first thing users see  
**How:** Make it helpful, not just a message

## Go / No-Go Decision

### Go If:
- ✅ PR #2 (Import) complete with clips in state
- ✅ PR #3 (Player) complete and loading clips
- ✅ You have 4+ hours available
- ✅ Excited to build visual timeline
- ✅ Clear on integration points
- ✅ Ready for testing-heavy work

### No-Go If:
- ❌ PR #2 or #3 incomplete (blocked on dependencies)
- ❌ Less than 2 hours available (won't finish properly)
- ❌ Unclear on component architecture
- ❌ Not ready to test integration
- ❌ Already stressed about timeline

**Decision Aid:** If dependencies aren't ready but you're confident in the design, you can build with mock data and integrate later. This is better than waiting.
