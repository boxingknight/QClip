# PR#01: Project Setup - Quick Start

---

## TL;DR (30 seconds)

**What:** Initialize Electron + React project structure with all dependencies and configuration files.

**Why:** Foundation for entire ClipForge application. No other PRs can proceed without this.

**Time:** 4 hours estimated

**Complexity:** LOW - Standard setup, well-documented

**Status:** üìã READY TO START

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Command not found: npm"
**Symptoms:** Terminal says npm not found  
**Cause:** Node.js not installed or not in PATH  
**Solution:**
```bash
# Install Node.js from nodejs.org
# Or use nvm to install: nvm install 18
# Restart terminal after installation
```

### Issue 2: "Cannot find module 'electron'"
**Symptoms:** Error when running electron  
**Cause:** Dependencies not installed  
**Solution:**
```bash
# Delete node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Issue 3: "Webpack not found"
**Symptoms:** Cannot run webpack commands  
**Cause:** Webpack not installed or not in PATH  
**Solution:**
```bash
# Install webpack as dev dependency
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli

# Or use npx
npx webpack
```

### Issue 4: "Electron window opens but is blank"
**Symptoms:** Window opens but doesn't show React app  
**Cause:** Webpack dev server not running or wrong URL  
**Solution:**
```bash
# Run webpack dev server first (terminal 1)
npm run dev

# Then run electron (terminal 2)
npm start

# Or update start script to use concurrently
```

### Issue 5: "IPC communication not working"
**Symptoms:** Console shows undefined for window.electronAPI  
**Cause:** Preload script not loaded or context isolation issue  
**Solution:**
- [ ] Verify preload path in main.js
- [ ] Verify contextBridge in preload.js
- [ ] Check window.openDevTools() works
- [ ] Reload window after changes

### Issue 6: "Build fails with Babel errors"
**Symptoms:** Babel loader errors during webpack build  
**Cause:** Missing babel presets  
**Solution:**
```bash
# Install babel preset
npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-react

# Verify .babelrc or webpack babel-loader config
```

## Quick Reference

### Key Files Created
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.gitignore` | Git ignore patterns |
| `package.json` | npm configuration, dependencies |
| `webpack.config.js` | Webpack bundling configuration |
| `electron-builder.yml` | Build/packaging configuration |
| `main.js` | Electron main process |
| `preload.js` | IPC bridge |
| `src/index.js` | React entry point |
| `src/App.js` | Main React component |
| `src/App.css` | App styles |
| `src/index.html` | HTML template |
| `README.md` | Project documentation |

### Key Commands
```bash
# Start development (terminal 1)
npm run dev

# Start Electron (terminal 2)
npm start

# Build for production
npm run build

# Package app
npm run package

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Clear and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install
```

### Key Concepts
- **Electron Main Process:** Runs Node.js, handles file operations
- **Renderer Process:** Runs React app (browser environment)
- **IPC:** Inter-process communication between main and renderer
- **Preload Script:** Secure bridge for IPC communication
- **Webpack:** Bundles React code for Electron renderer

### Project Structure

## Success Metrics

**You'll know it's working when:**
- [ ] Running `npm start` opens Electron window
- [ ] Window shows "Welcome to ClipForge" message
- [ ] Console shows "IPC test: pong"
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Can close and reopen app without errors

**Performance Targets:**
- Electron window opens in <5 seconds
- React app renders immediately
- No memory leaks when opening/closing window

## Help & Support

### Stuck?
1. Check main specification (`PR01_PROJECT_SETUP.md`) for details
2. Review implementation checklist step-by-step
3. Check Common Issues section above
4. Look at Electron + React boilerplate examples online
5. Ask in team chat (if applicable)

### Want to Skip Details?
**Can't skip:** This PR is the foundation. Every file is needed.

### Running Out of Time?
**Focus on:**
1. Getting app to launch (main.js, index.js, App.js)
2. IPC working (preload.js)
3. Webpack config working

**Can skip/polish later:**
- Perfect styling
- Extensive README
- Advanced webpack optimization

## Motivation

**You've got this!** üí™

This is your foundation. Once this is done, you can start building the actual video editing features. Every minute you spend getting this setup right saves hours later.

**Remember:** The other 9 PRs depend on this one being solid.

## Next Steps

**When ready:**
1. Read implementation checklist
2. Start with Phase 1: Git & npm initialization
3. Follow checklist step-by-step
4. Commit after each phase
5. Test as you go
6. Celebrate when app launches! üéâ

**Status:** Ready to build! üöÄ

**Expected Outcome:** Electron window with "Welcome to ClipForge" displaying all green checkmarks

**After Completion:** Move to PR #2: File Import (4 hours, Day 1, Hours 5-8)
