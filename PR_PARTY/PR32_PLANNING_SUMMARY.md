## What We're Building

### Core Feature: Picture-in-Picture Recording

**Single composited video file** containing:
- Screen content (full resolution)
- Webcam overlay (15-50% of screen width, positioned in corner)
- Audio from user-selected source (webcam, screen, both, or none)

**User Experience:**
- Select screen source (same as PR#17)
- Select webcam device (same as PR#18)
- Configure PIP settings:
  - Position: 4 corners (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right)
  - Size: Presets (Small 15%, Medium 25%, Large 35%) + custom slider (10-50%)
  - Audio: Dropdown (Webcam, Screen, Both, None)
- Preview composited view before recording
- Start/stop recording
- Save to Media Library (same as other recordings)

---

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Canvas-Based Compositing ✅
**Choice:** Use HTML5 Canvas to composite both streams, record canvas stream  
**Rationale:**
- Real-time compositing with precise control
- Preview matches output exactly
- Single-step recording (no post-processing)
- Works with existing MediaRecorder infrastructure

**Impact:** Need to implement canvas rendering loop at 30fps, manage video elements, handle canvas stream capture

### Decision 2: Single Hidden Canvas ✅
**Choice:** One hidden canvas for compositing, separate from UI  
**Rationale:**
- Simple state management
- Clear rendering pipeline
- Hidden canvas avoids UI complexity
- RequestAnimationFrame for smooth rendering

**Impact:** Straightforward implementation, no canvas UI complexity

### Decision 3: User-Selectable Audio ✅
**Choice:** Let user choose audio source (webcam, screen, both, none)  
**Rationale:**
- Different use cases need different audio
- Most users will use webcam mic (default)
- Supports all scenarios flexibly

**Impact:** Need audio mixing utilities using AudioContext, UI dropdown for selection

### Decision 4: Four Corner Positioning ✅
**Choice:** Fixed corner positions (no free-hand positioning)  
**Rationale:**
- Covers 99% of use cases
- Simple UI (dropdown)
- Matches professional software
- No complex drag-and-drop needed

**Impact:** Simple position calculation, clean UI with dropdown selector

### Decision 5: Size Presets + Custom ✅
**Choice:** Presets (Small/Medium/Large) + custom slider  
**Rationale:**
- Quick selection for common sizes
- Custom option for flexibility
- Slider shows current percentage

**Impact:** UI with preset buttons and range slider

## Implementation Strategy

### Timeline
```
Day 1 (4-5 hours):
├─ Phase 1: Canvas Compositing Foundation (2-3h)
│  └─ PIP utilities, canvas compositing hook
└─ Phase 2: Start PIP Recording (2h)
   └─ RecordingContext extension, startPIPRecording

Day 2 (4-5 hours):
├─ Phase 2: Complete PIP Recording (1-2h)
├─ Phase 3: Audio Mixing (1-2h)
└─ Phase 4: UI Components (2-3h)
   └─ PIPSettings, PIPPreview, PIPRecordingControls

Day 3 (1 hour):
└─ Phase 5: Integration & Polish (1h)
   └─ Error handling, performance, final testing
```

### Key Principle
**"Get canvas compositing working first, then build everything else on top."**

Canvas compositing is the foundation. Once video elements draw to canvas and canvas stream is captured, everything else is straightforward state management and UI.

### Technical Approach
1. **Foundation First:** Canvas compositing hook (Phase 1)
2. **Core Functionality:** Recording implementation (Phase 2)
3. **Enhancement:** Audio mixing (Phase 3)
4. **User Experience:** UI components (Phase 4)
5. **Polish:** Integration and testing (Phase 5)

## Risks Identified & Mitigated

### Risk 1: Canvas Performance 🟡 MEDIUM
**Issue:** Canvas rendering at 30fps may cause performance issues  
**Mitigation:**
- Frame timing to throttle to exactly 30fps
- `willReadFrequently: false` on canvas context
- Match canvas resolution to screen (no upscaling)
- Test with high-resolution screens early
- Monitor CPU/GPU usage during development

**Status:** Mitigated - Performance targets documented, optimization strategies in place

### Risk 2: Audio Mixing Complexity 🟡 MEDIUM
**Issue:** Audio mixing can be complex and error-prone  
**Mitigation:**
- Start with single audio source (Phase 3 MVP)
- Add mixing as enhancement after core works
- Clear fallback if mixing fails
- Test audio scenarios early

**Status:** Mitigated - Phased approach, fallback strategies documented

### Risk 3: Permission Handling 🟡 MEDIUM
**Issue:** Need both screen AND webcam permissions  
**Mitigation:**
- Handle each permission separately
- Clear error messages for denied permissions
- Allow graceful degradation (show which permission failed)
- Guide users to system preferences

**Status:** Mitigated - Error handling documented for all scenarios

### Risk 4: Device Disconnection 🟢 LOW
**Issue:** Screen or webcam could disconnect during recording  
**Mitigation:**
- Monitor stream track `ended` events
- Stop recording gracefully if either stream disconnects
- Save partial recording if possible
- Clear error messages

**Status:** Mitigated - Disconnection handling documented

**Overall Risk:** 🟡 MEDIUM - Mitigations in place, phased approach reduces risk

## Hot Tips

### Tip 1: Start with Canvas Compositing
**Why:** Everything else builds on this. Get canvas drawing both streams correctly first, then add recording, then UI.

### Tip 2: Test with Simple Cases First
**Why:** Test with static colors/images before video streams. Test with one stream before two. Build complexity gradually.

### Tip 3: Frame Timing is Critical
**Why:** Use performance.now() for frame timing, not setTimeout. RequestAnimationFrame gives smooth 30fps rendering.

### Tip 4: Wait for Video Metadata
**Why:** Canvas size must match screen video dimensions. Wait for `onloadedmetadata` before setting canvas size and starting capture.

### Tip 5: Audio Mixing Has Fallbacks
**Why:** If audio mixing fails, fall back to single source. If both sources fail, continue without audio (acceptable).

## Go / No-Go Decision

### Go If:
- ✅ PR#17 (Screen Recording) complete and tested
- ✅ PR#18 (Webcam Recording) complete and tested
- ✅ You have 8-10 hours available
- ✅ Excited about building compositing feature
- ✅ Canvas CaptureStream API supported in environment

### No-Go If:
- ❌ PR#17 or PR#18 not complete (blocking)
- ❌ Time-constrained (< 8 hours)
- ❌ Canvas performance concerns on target hardware
- ❌ Not a priority for current milestone

**Decision Aid:** If screen and webcam recording both work reliably, PIP is the natural next step. This is expected functionality in professional recording software.

---

## Immediate Next Actions

### Pre-Flight (5 minutes)
- [ ] Verify PR#17 and PR#18 are working
- [ ] Check Canvas CaptureStream API support
- [ ] Create feature branch: `feature/pr32-picture-in-picture-recording`
- [ ] Review main specification document

### Day 1 Goals (4-5 hours)
- [ ] Phase 1: Canvas Compositing Foundation
  - [ ] Create PIP utilities (pipUtils.js)
  - [ ] Create canvas compositing hook
  - [ ] Test with simple cases
- [ ] Phase 2: Start PIP Recording
  - [ ] Extend RecordingContext
  - [ ] Start implementing startPIPRecording()

**Checkpoint:** Canvas successfully composites two video streams, can start basic PIP recording

**Next Step:** When ready, start with Phase 1: Canvas Compositing Foundation

**You've got this!** 💪

ClipForge already has professional screen and webcam recording. Picture-in-picture is the natural completion of the recording suite. The canvas compositing approach is proven, and once the foundation works, everything else builds on it smoothly.
