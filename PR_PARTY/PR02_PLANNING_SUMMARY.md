## What We're Building

### Core Features

| Feature | Time | Priority | Impact |
|---------|------|----------|--------|
| File validation (MP4/MOV) | 30 min | HIGH | Prevents invalid files |
| Drag-and-drop import | 45 min | MEDIUM | Modern UX, intuitive |
| File picker import | 30 min | HIGH | Reliable, familiar |
| IPC file dialog | 30 min | HIGH | Required for picker |
| App state integration | 45 min | HIGH | Enables editing workflow |
| Styling and UX | 45 min | MEDIUM | Professional appearance |
| Testing and validation | 30 min | HIGH | Quality assurance |

**Total Time:** 4 hours

**Additional Considerations:**
- Error handling for invalid files
- Multiple file import support
- Visual feedback (drag-over state)
- Loading states during import

---

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Dual Import Methods
**Choice:** Implement both drag-and-drop AND file picker  
**Rationale:**
- Maximum usability coverage (supports all user preferences)
- Drag-and-drop is modern and intuitive
- File picker is familiar and reliable
- Low overhead to implement both

**Impact:** Users can choose their preferred import method, increasing usability and reducing friction. Trade-off is slightly more code to maintain (minimal).

### Decision 2: Client-Side Validation
**Choice:** Validate files on import, not during playback  
**Rationale:**
- Fast import process (no file reading)
- Immediate user feedback (errors shown instantly)
- Fail gracefully (corrupted files detected during playback)
- Extension check sufficient for MVP

**Impact:** Fast, responsive import experience. File validation is lightweight and doesn't block the UI. Potential for some validation inconsistencies if file has invalid extension but valid codec (unlikely).

### Decision 3: React State Management
**Choice:** Use React useState in App.js, not external state library  
**Rationale:**
- Simplest approach for MVP
- No external dependencies
- Single source of truth (clips array)
- Easy to lift state and pass down

**Impact:** Simple, maintainable state management. Easy to understand and debug. Trade-off is state resets on app restart (acceptable for MVP, can add persistence later).

### Decision 4: IPC Before Video Processing
**Choice:** Return file paths via IPC, not video metadata  
**Rationale:**
- Fast import (don't read large video files)
- Keep renderer process lightweight
- Extract metadata during playback when needed
- Non-blocking import process

**Impact:** Fast, non-blocking import experience. Users can import multiple files quickly without waiting for metadata extraction. Metadata can be lazy-loaded when needed (e.g., during timeline rendering or playback).

## Implementation Strategy

### Timeline
```
Phase 1: File Validation (30 min)
‚îú‚îÄ Create fileHelpers.js
‚îú‚îÄ Implement isValidVideoFile()
‚îú‚îÄ Implement isFileSizeValid()
‚îî‚îÄ Implement validateFile()

Phase 2: ImportPanel Component (90 min)
‚îú‚îÄ Create component structure
‚îú‚îÄ Implement drag-and-drop handlers
‚îú‚îÄ Implement file picker
‚îú‚îÄ Implement processFiles()
‚îî‚îÄ Add UI elements

Phase 3: IPC Setup (30 min)
‚îú‚îÄ Update preload.js
‚îî‚îÄ Update main.js with handlers

Phase 4: App State Integration (45 min)
‚îú‚îÄ Add clips state to App.js
‚îú‚îÄ Implement handleImport()
‚îî‚îÄ Connect ImportPanel to App

Phase 5: Styling (45 min)
‚îú‚îÄ Create ImportPanel.css
‚îú‚îÄ Style drag-over state
‚îî‚îÄ Add error and loading styles

Phase 6: Testing (30 min)
‚îú‚îÄ Unit tests for validation
‚îî‚îÄ Integration tests for import flow
```

**Key Principle:** Test after EACH phase. Don't wait until the end!

- [ ] Zero crashes on invalid files
- [ ] Multiple file import works

### Qualitative
- [ ] UI provides clear visual feedback
- [ ] Error messages are helpful
- [ ] Import feels smooth and responsive
- [ ] Users can understand what files are imported

## Risks Identified & Mitigated

### Risk 1: IPC Communication Issues üü° MEDIUM
**Issue:** IPC handlers not working correctly, breaking file import  
**Mitigation:** 
- Test IPC communication early in Phase 3
- Add console logging for debugging
- Handle errors gracefully in IPC calls
- Verify window.electronAPI is exposed

**Status:** Documented, ready to test early

### Risk 2: File Path Resolution üü¢ LOW
**Issue:** Relative vs absolute paths causing file not found errors  
**Mitigation:**
- Use path.resolve() in main process
- Get absolute path via IPC helper function
- Test with files in different directories
- Log paths for debugging

**Status:** Documented, straightforward to fix

### Risk 3: Drag-and-Drop Event Handling üü° MEDIUM
**Issue:** Drag events not triggering correctly  
**Mitigation:**
- Call preventDefault() on dragOver
- Use proper event handlers
- Test with real files (not just DOM elements)
- Add visual feedback (drag-over state)

**Status:** Documented, common HTML5 API pattern

### Risk 4: State Management Complexity üü¢ LOW
**Issue:** Clips array not updating correctly  
**Mitigation:**
- Use React useState properly
- Spread existing array when adding new clips
- Test state updates with console.log
- Keep state structure simple

**Status:** Documented, standard React pattern

**Overall Risk:** üü¢ LOW - Well-understood patterns, good documentation, minimal complexity

## Hot Tips

### Tip 1: Test Early and Often
**Why:** IPC communication issues are easier to debug when you test immediately after adding handlers. Don't implement everything then test - test after each phase.

### Tip 2: Use Console.log for Debugging
**Why:** Logging file paths, validation results, and IPC calls will save hours of debugging later. Remove before final commit, but use liberally during development.

### Tip 3: Start with File Picker
**Why:** File picker is more reliable than drag-and-drop. Implement file picker first, test it works, then add drag-and-drop as enhancement.

### Tip 4: Don't Store Video Data
**Why:** Store file paths only. Import should be fast. Video data is large and unnecessary for state management. Let the video element handle file access.

### Tip 5: Test with Real Files
**Why:** Don't test with mock objects. Use actual MP4 and MOV files. Test with large files (>100MB) to verify performance. Test with invalid files (AVI) to verify error handling.

## Go / No-Go Decision

### Go If:
- ‚úÖ PR #1 complete (Electron + React running)
- ‚úÖ You have 4+ hours available
- ‚úÖ IPC system configured in main.js
- ‚úÖ Ready to implement foundation feature

### No-Go If:
- ‚ùå PR #1 not complete (can't build without base)
- ‚ùå Less than 3 hours available (need buffer)
- ‚ùå IPC not configured (must have file access)
- ‚ùå Not comfortable with file handling

**Decision Aid:** This is a critical path feature - if you have time and PR #1 is done, build it. If you're running out of time, skip to later features, but note this blocks video playback and timeline.

**Recommendation:** ‚úÖ GO - This is foundational and must be built for MVP.

## Immediate Next Actions

### Pre-Flight (5 minutes)
- [ ] Verify PR #1 complete
- [ ] Test app launches: `npm start`
- [ ] Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/file-import`

### Hour 1: File Validation & Component Setup (2 hours)
- [ ] Create fileHelpers.js with validation functions
- [ ] Create ImportPanel.js component structure
- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop handlers
- [ ] Implement file picker button

**Checkpoint:** Can drag files over drop zone with visual feedback

### Hour 2: IPC & State Integration (2 hours)
- [ ] Add IPC handlers to main.js and preload.js
- [ ] Add clips state to App.js
- [ ] Implement handleImport function
- [ ] Connect ImportPanel to App state
- [ ] Test full import flow

**Checkpoint:** Files import successfully and appear in UI

---

## Conclusion

**Planning Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Confidence Level:** HIGH  
**Recommendation:** Build this feature - it's critical path and well-planned

**Time Investment:** 1.5 hours planning for 4 hours implementation  
**Expected ROI:** Planning will save 1-2 hours of debugging and refactoring during implementation

**Next Step:** When ready, start with Phase 1: File Validation Utilities.

**You've got this!** üí™

File import is a well-understood pattern. You've seen drag-and-drop in countless apps. You know how React state works. You've used file pickers before. The implementation is straightforward - validate files, process them, store them. You have clear documentation, step-by-step checklist, and working examples. This will go smoothly.

Remember: Test after each phase. Don't wait until the end. And if something goes wrong, you have troubleshooting guides ready.
