# PR#13: Professional Timeline Implementation - Quick Start

---

## TL;DR (30 seconds)

**What:** Complete replacement of current timeline with professional-grade multi-track editing system featuring magnetic behavior, edge trimming, and advanced clip manipulation.

**Why:** Users expect modern video editing tools with industry-standard features like CapCut and iMovie.

**Time:** 24-32 hours estimated

**Complexity:** HIGH

**Status:** üìã PLANNED

## Decision Framework (2 minutes)

### Should You Build This?

**Green Lights (Build it!):**
- ‚úÖ You have 24+ hours available for implementation
- ‚úÖ Current timeline implementation is stable and backed up
- ‚úÖ You want professional-grade video editing capabilities
- ‚úÖ You're ready to replace the existing timeline completely
- ‚úÖ You understand this is a major architectural change

**Red Lights (Skip/defer it!):**
- ‚ùå Time-constrained (<24 hours available)
- ‚ùå Current timeline works well enough for MVP
- ‚ùå Prefer incremental improvements over complete replacement
- ‚ùå Not comfortable with major architectural changes
- ‚ùå Other priorities take precedence

**Decision Aid:** This is a major feature that will significantly improve user experience but requires substantial time investment. Only proceed if you're committed to the full implementation.

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Performance with Many Clips
**Symptoms:** Timeline becomes slow with 50+ clips  
**Cause:** Rendering all clips at once without optimization  
**Solution:** Implement virtual scrolling and lazy loading
```javascript
// Use React.memo for clip components
const Clip = React.memo(({ clip }) => {
  // Component implementation
});

// Implement virtual scrolling
const VirtualizedTimeline = ({ clips }) => {
  const [visibleRange, setVisibleRange] = useState({ start: 0, end: 20 });
  // Only render visible clips
};
```

### Issue 2: Magnetic Snap Not Working
**Symptoms:** Clips don't snap to each other  
**Cause:** Snap threshold too small or snap points not calculated correctly  
**Solution:** Debug snap calculations and adjust threshold
```javascript
// Debug snap points
const debugSnapPoints = (clipId, position) => {
  const snapPoints = findSnapPoints(clipId, position);
  console.log('Snap points:', snapPoints);
  return snapPoints;
};
```

### Issue 3: Edge Trimming Causing Crashes
**Symptoms:** App crashes when trimming clip edges  
**Cause:** Invalid trim values or state updates  
**Solution:** Add validation and error handling
```javascript
const validateTrim = (trimIn, trimOut, duration) => {
  if (trimIn < 0 || trimOut > duration || trimIn >= trimOut) {
    throw new Error('Invalid trim values');
  }
  return { trimIn, trimOut };
};
```

### Issue 4: State Management Complexity
**Symptoms:** State updates causing unexpected behavior  
**Cause:** Complex state structure with many interdependent values  
**Solution:** Use reducer pattern and immutable updates
```javascript
const timelineReducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'MOVE_CLIP':
      return {
        ...state,
        clips: state.clips.map(clip =>
          clip.id === action.clipId
            ? { ...clip, startTime: action.startTime }
            : clip
        )
      };
    // Other cases...
  }
};
```

## Quick Reference

### Key Files
- `src/context/TimelineContext.js` - Enhanced state management
- `src/components/timeline/Timeline.js` - Main timeline component
- `src/components/timeline/Track.js` - Individual track component
- `src/components/timeline/Clip.js` - Individual clip component
- `src/utils/timelineCalculations.js` - Time/pixel conversion utilities

### Key Functions
- `timeToPixels(time, zoom)` - Convert time to pixel position
- `pixelsToTime(pixels, zoom)` - Convert pixel position to time
- `findSnapPoints(clipId, position)` - Find magnetic snap points
- `trimClip(clipId, trimIn, trimOut)` - Trim clip edges
- `splitClip(clipId, splitTime)` - Split clip at time

### Key Concepts
- **Magnetic Timeline:** Clips automatically snap to each other
- **Edge Trimming:** Drag clip edges to trim start/end
- **Multi-Track:** Multiple independent tracks for different content types
- **Selection Management:** Handle single and multiple clip selection
- **Undo/Redo:** Complete operation history

### Useful Commands
```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Build
npm run build

# Start development
npm start

# Check bundle size
npm run analyze
```

## Success Metrics

**You'll know it's working when:**
- [ ] Clips snap to each other when dragged
- [ ] Edge trimming works with visual feedback
- [ ] Multiple tracks can be added and managed
- [ ] Timeline scrubbing is smooth and responsive
- [ ] All clip operations (split, copy, paste, delete) work
- [ ] Undo/redo system functions properly
- [ ] Performance is smooth with 50+ clips

**Performance Targets:**
- Timeline rendering: < 16ms (60fps)
- Clip operations: < 100ms response time
- Memory usage: < 200MB for 100 clips

## Help & Support

### Stuck?
1. Check main planning doc for detailed architecture
2. Review implementation checklist for step-by-step guidance
3. Check existing timeline implementation for reference
4. Search memory bank for similar patterns

### Want to Skip a Feature?
- **Edge Trimming:** Can be deferred to Phase 4
- **Magnetic Snap:** Can be simplified to basic snapping
- **Multi-Track:** Can start with single track and expand
- **Undo/Redo:** Can be implemented later

### Running Out of Time?
- Focus on Phase 1 (Core Foundation) - 8-10 hours
- Implement basic multi-track without advanced features
- Defer magnetic snap and edge trimming to future PR
- Prioritize working timeline over perfect features
