# PR#17: Screen Recording Setup - Quick Start

**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE & DEPLOYED  
**Actual Time:** ~26 hours (6 hours estimated, 4x due to extensive bug fixes)  
**Completed:** October 29, 2024  
**Complexity:** HIGH

---

## TL;DR (30 seconds)

**What:** Screen recording functionality using Electron's desktopCapturer API and Web MediaRecorder API. Users can record their screen with system audio and save recordings directly to the Media Library.

**Why:** Screen recording is a key differentiator for ClipForge V2, enabling users to capture content directly without external tools. It transforms ClipForge into a complete capture-and-edit solution.

**Time:** 6 hours estimated

**Complexity:** HIGH

**Status:** üìã PLANNING COMPLETE

## Decision Framework (2 minutes)

### Should You Build This?

**Green Lights (Build it!):**
- ‚úÖ PR #11 (State Management Refactor) complete
- ‚úÖ PR #12 (UI Component Library) complete
- ‚úÖ PR #13 (Professional Timeline) complete
- ‚úÖ Have 6+ hours available
- ‚úÖ Excited about recording features
- ‚úÖ macOS permissions configured (for testing)

**Red Lights (Skip/defer it!):**
- ‚ùå Prerequisites not complete
- ‚ùå Time-constrained (<6 hours)
- ‚ùå Other priorities (bug fixes, critical features)
- ‚ùå Not interested in recording functionality
- ‚ùå Cannot test on macOS (required for Electron desktopCapturer)

**Decision Aid:** This is a foundational feature for V2's recording capabilities (PR#18 Webcam, PR#19 Audio Mixing depend on this infrastructure). If you want ClipForge to be a complete capture-and-edit solution, this is essential. If you're focused on editing features only, consider deferring.

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Permission denied" when getting sources
**Symptoms:** Error when calling getScreenSources  
**Cause:** macOS screen recording permission not granted  
**Solution:**
1. Go to System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí Privacy
2. Select "Screen Recording"
3. Check the box next to "Electron" or your app
4. Restart Electron app

```bash
# If permission still not working, check in terminal:
tccutil reset ScreenCapture
```

### Issue 2: MediaRecorder not supported
**Symptoms:** MediaRecorder constructor throws error  
**Cause:** Browser/Electron version doesn't support MediaRecorder  
**Solution:**
- Check Electron version (should be 15+)
- Add feature detection before creating MediaRecorder:
```javascript
if (!MediaRecorder.isTypeSupported('video/webm')) {
  throw new Error('MediaRecorder not supported');
}
```

### Issue 3: No screen sources returned
**Symptoms:** Empty array from getScreenSources  
**Cause:** Permission denied or no screens available  
**Solution:**
1. Verify permissions (see Issue 1)
2. Check if Electron window has focus
3. Try restarting Electron app

### Issue 4: Recording file corrupted or unplayable
**Symptoms:** Saved video file won't play  
**Cause:** Chunks not collected properly or blob construction issue  
**Solution:**
- Verify chunks are collected in `ondataavailable`
- Check blob type matches MediaRecorder mimeType
- Test with different codecs (vp8 fallback)

### Issue 5: High memory usage during recording
**Symptoms:** Memory usage > 500MB during recording  
**Cause:** Chunks accumulating without cleanup  
**Solution:**
- Ensure chunks are written to file periodically
- Clear chunks after saving
- Consider streaming to file instead of accumulating in memory

## Quick Reference

### Key Files
- `main.js` - IPC handlers for screen sources
- `preload.js` - Exposed recording APIs
- `src/context/RecordingContext.js` - Recording state management
- `src/components/recording/RecordingControls.js` - Main recording UI
- `src/components/recording/SourcePicker.js` - Source selection modal
- `src/components/recording/RecordingIndicator.js` - Recording status display

### Key Functions

## Help & Support

### Stuck?
1. Check main planning doc for detailed architecture
2. Review similar implementation (PR#12 UI Components for modal patterns)
3. Check bug analysis docs for similar issues
4. Search memory bank for patterns

### Want to Skip a Feature?
You can defer:
- MP4 conversion (can save as WebM for now)
- Multi-source recording (single source is sufficient)
- Recording options UI (use defaults)

You cannot skip:
- Basic screen recording (core feature)
- Source selection (required for UX)
- File saving (required for workflow)

### Running Out of Time?
**Priority Order:**
1. **Must Have:** Screen recording with source selection, file save
2. **Should Have:** Recording indicator, Media Library integration
3. **Nice to Have:** Recording options UI, error messages polish

**Minimum Viable:**
- Get sources
- Start recording
- Stop recording
- Save file
- Appears in Media Library

## Motivation

**You've got this!** üí™

ClipForge already has professional timeline editing (PR#13) and drag-and-drop (PR#14). Adding screen recording transforms it from a video editor into a complete capture-and-edit solution. This is the foundation for webcam recording (PR#18) and advanced audio mixing (PR#19).

**Impact:** Users can now record their screen directly in ClipForge, edit immediately, and export‚Äîall without leaving the app. This is a key differentiator from basic video editors.

## Next Steps

**When ready:**
1. Run prerequisites check (5 min)
2. Read main spec (30 min)
3. Start Phase 1 from checklist (1.5h)
4. Commit early and often

**Status:** Ready to build! üöÄ
