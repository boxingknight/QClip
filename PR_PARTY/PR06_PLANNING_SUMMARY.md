## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: App-Level Trim State
**Choice:** Lift trim state (`trimData`) to App.js, not local TrimControls state  
**Rationale:** Single source of truth, needed by Timeline and Export  
**Impact:** Predictable state flow, easy to reset on clip change

### Decision 2: Time Update Callback Pattern
**Choice:** VideoPlayer emits `onTimeUpdate` callback to parent  
**Rationale:** React best practice, clean separation of concerns  
**Impact:** Simple implementation, child controls playback time

### Decision 3: Visual + Text Feedback
**Choice:** Show trim times as text AND visual indicators on timeline  
**Rationale:** Users need both precision and visual understanding  
**Impact:** Professional UX, clear what's being exported

### Decision 4: Auto-Reset on Clip Change
**Choice:** Automatically reset trim when selecting new clip  
**Rationale:** Each clip should start with full range as default  
**Impact:** Prevents confusion, clean slate for each clip

### Decision 5: Comprehensive Validation
**Choice:** Validate trim settings (in < out, bounds checking, min duration)  
**Rationale:** Better UX than letting FFmpeg fail  
**Impact:** User-friendly error messages, professional feel

## Implementation Strategy

### Timeline
```
Hour 1-2: Component UI & State Management
├─ Create TrimControls component
├─ Add time display and buttons
├─ Add trim state to App.js
└─ Create event handlers

Hour 3: Time Updates
├─ Add onTimeUpdate to VideoPlayer
├─ Connect time updates to App state
└─ Test time tracking

Hour 4: Visual Indicators
├─ Add trim data to Timeline
├─ Render trim indicators
└─ Style overlay regions

Hour 5: Export Integration
├─ Update ExportPanel to use trim data
├─ Add FFmpeg trim support
└─ Test export with trim

Hour 6: Polish & Testing
├─ Add error states
├─ Test complete workflow
├─ Fix edge cases
└─ Verify exported duration
```

### Key Principle
**Test the core workflow early:** Set In → Set Out → Export must work within first 3 hours. If not, debug state flow immediately.

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- [ ] Set In/Out buttons work correctly
- [ ] Timeline shows trim indicators
- [ ] Exported video duration matches `outPoint - inPoint`
- [ ] Time updates at 60fps without lag
- [ ] Export completes successfully with trim

### Qualitative
- [ ] UX feels professional (Premiere/Final Cut like)
- [ ] Visual feedback is obvious and accurate
- [ ] Error messages are helpful
- [ ] Workflow is intuitive

## Risks Identified & Mitigated

### Risk 1: Time Synchronization Issues 🟡 MEDIUM
**Issue:** Time updates may not sync correctly between VideoPlayer and TrimControls  
**Mitigation:** Use standard React callback pattern, add debug logging  
**Status:** Documented and planned

### Risk 2: Trim Validation Bugs 🟡 MEDIUM
**Issue:** Validation logic may have edge cases  
**Mitigation:** Comprehensive validation, test edge cases thoroughly  
**Status:** Validation logic specified in detail

### Risk 3: FFmpeg Trim Integration 🟡 MEDIUM  
**Issue:** FFmpeg trim commands may not work as expected  
**Mitigation:** Test FFmpeg commands separately, verify output duration  
**Status:** FFmpeg logic specified with code examples

### Risk 4: State Management Complexity 🟡 MEDIUM
**Issue:** Managing trim state across multiple components  
**Mitigation:** Keep state simple (inPoint, outPoint only), clear data flow  
**Status:** Data flow diagram created

### Risk 5: Integration Issues 🔴 HIGH
**Issue:** Coordinating with VideoPlayer, Timeline, and Export components  
**Mitigation:** Incremental integration, test after each phase  
**Status:** Marked as high risk—must coordinate carefully

**Overall Risk:** 🟡 MEDIUM - Manageable with careful implementation and testing

## Hot Tips

### Tip 1: Test State Flow Early
Start with TrimControls and App state (Phase 1-2). Get buttons working and state updating. Don't move to visual indicators until this works.

### Tip 2: Use Console Logging
Add `console.log` to track time updates and state changes. It's the fastest way to debug state flow issues.

### Tip 3: Validate in Real Time
Add validation to button disable logic, not just error display. Better UX: prevent bad actions than show errors.

### Tip 4: Test Export First
Test FFmpeg trim support with hardcoded values before integrating with UI. Ensures FFmpeg logic is correct.

### Tip 5: Visualize Trim Data
When trim indicators aren't working, console.log `trimData` to see if it's being passed correctly to Timeline.

## Go / No-Go Decision

### Go If:
- ✅ PR #3 (Video Player) complete
- ✅ PR #5 (Timeline) complete  
- ✅ You have 6+ hours available
- ✅ Comfortable with React state management
- ✅ Understand trim workflow (in/out points)

### No-Go If:
- ❌ Prerequisites incomplete (PR #3, #5)
- ❌ Less than 4 hours available
- ❌ Unfamiliar with state lifting
- ❌ Not comfortable with multi-component integration

**Decision Aid:** If Video Player plays video and Timeline shows clips, you're ready. Trim is the logical next step.

---

## Immediate Next Actions

### Pre-Flight (5 minutes)
- [ ] Verify PR #3 and PR #5 complete
- [ ] Open App.js and check state structure
- [ ] Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/pr06-trim-controls`

### Hour 1-2 Goals
- [ ] Create TrimControls component structure
- [ ] Add Set In/Out buttons
- [ ] Add trim state to App.js
- [ ] Create handlers (setInPoint, setOutPoint, reset)

### Hour 3 Goals
- [ ] Add onTimeUpdate to VideoPlayer
- [ ] Connect time updates to App
- [ ] Verify current time displays correctly
- [ ] Test: Set In/Out buttons update state

**Checkpoint:** Core trim functionality working (Set In/Out buttons work, state updates)

## Conclusion

**Planning Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Confidence Level:** 🟢 HIGH  
**Recommendation:** BUILD IT

Trim Controls is the critical feature that completes ClipForge's core editing workflow. With comprehensive planning (40,000 words), clear implementation checklist, and detailed technical specification, you have everything needed for confident implementation.

**Next Step:** When ready, start with Phase 1 from implementation checklist.

---

**You've got this!** 💪

Trim is where ClipForge becomes a real video editor. You're building the feature that every user will use for every export. The planning is complete, the path is clear, and the implementation is straightforward.

*"The best time to add trim was before Timeline. The second best time is now."*
