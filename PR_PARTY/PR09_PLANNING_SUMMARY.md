## What We're Building

### Overview
Package ClipForge as a distributable macOS DMG installer with all dependencies bundled. This is the final validation checkpoint that the app works in production.

### Features

| Feature | Time | Priority | Impact |
|---------|------|----------|--------|
| electron-builder Configuration | 30min | HIGH | Foundation |
| FFmpeg Binary Bundling | 15min | CRITICAL | Functionality |
| Production Path Resolution | 45min | CRITICAL | Functionality |
| Build & Package | 30min | HIGH | Output |
| Test in Packaged App | 1h | CRITICAL | Validation |
| Fix Issues (if any) | 30min | HIGH | Quality |
| Documentation | 30min | MEDIUM | User guidance |

**Total Time:** 2-4 hours (varies with issues)

---

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: electron-builder over electron-packager
**Choice:** Use electron-builder for comprehensive packaging  
**Rationale:**
- Handles code signing automatically
- Generates DMG installer
- Well-documented and proven
- Can add auto-updates later

**Impact:** Professional output with minimal setup

### Decision 2: Bundle FFmpeg Binaries
**Choice:** Include ~60MB of FFmpeg binaries in app bundle  
**Rationale:**
- Better UX (works out of box)
- No installation instructions needed
- Reliable in packaged app
- Expected for video editors

**Impact:** Larger app but zero-friction experience

### Decision 3: Skip Code Signing for MVP
**Choice:** Ship unsigned app (users bypass Gatekeeper)  
**Rationale:**
- MVP deadline doesn't justify $99 certificate
- Users can right-click ‚Üí Open to bypass
- Document the bypass clearly
- Can upgrade to signed later

**Impact:** Fast to ship, minor user friction

### Decision 4: Smart Path Resolution
**Choice:** Auto-detect dev vs production environment  
**Rationale:**
- Works in both dev and production
- More maintainable
- Standard Electron practice
- Future-proof

**Impact:** Easier to test and maintain

### Decision 5: Test Early (Day 2, not Day 3)
**Choice:** Package and test on Day 2  
**Rationale:**
- Allows time for fixes if it fails
- Can't be discovered at the last minute
- Critical validation checkpoint
- Most likely to have issues

**Impact:** Risk mitigation, saves stress

## Implementation Strategy

### Timeline Breakdown

**Phase 1: Configuration (1 hour)**
```
Minutes 0-20:  electron-builder.yml setup
Minutes 20-35: package.json scripts
Minutes 35-60: Test configuration syntax
```

**Phase 2: Path Resolution (30 minutes)**
```
Minutes 0-20:  Update main.js for production
Minutes 20-30: Update videoProcessing.js
```

**Phase 3: Build & Test (1 hour)**
```
Minutes 0-5:   Build webpack bundle
Minutes 5-10:  Run electron-builder
Minutes 10-15: Verify DMG created
Minutes 15-20: Install app
Minutes 20-50: Test all features
Minutes 50-60: Check for errors
```

**Phase 4: Fixes & Documentation (30 minutes)**
```
Minutes 0-20:  Fix any issues
Minutes 20-30: Document build process
```

### Key Principle
**Test export immediately** - Most likely failure point

### Critical Success Factors
1. **FFmpeg Paths:** Most critical potential failure
2. **Test Everything:** Packaged app must match dev exactly
3. **Early Testing:** Day 2, not Day 3
4. **Document Bypass:** Users need Gatekeeper solution

## Risks Identified & Mitigated

### Risk 1: FFmpeg Binaries Not Found üî¥ HIGH
**Issue:** Production paths wrong, export fails  
**Mitigation:** 
- Test path resolution in dev first
- Add console logging for debugging
- Verify extraResources configuration
- Test thoroughly before submission

**Status:** üî¥ CRITICAL - Must test carefully

### Risk 2: Build Fails or Takes Too Long üî¥ HIGH
**Issue:** electron-builder errors or long build time  
**Mitigation:**
- Test early (Day 2, not Day 3)
- Verify all files included correctly
- Check dist/ folder contents
- Review build logs

**Status:** üî¥ CRITICAL - Test ASAP

### Risk 3: Packaged App Doesn't Work Like Dev üü° MEDIUM
**Issue:** Features break in production  
**Mitigation:**
- Test ALL features after packaging
- Compare dev vs packaged behavior
- Check for path issues
- Verify dependencies included

**Status:** üü° Monitor closely

### Risk 4: Gatekeeper Warnings Confuse Users üü¢ LOW
**Issue:** Users can't launch app  
**Mitigation:**
- Document bypass in README
- Include troubleshooting section
- This is expected for unsigned apps

**Status:** üü¢ Acceptable for MVP

### Risk 5: File Size Too Large üü¢ LOW
**Issue:** DMG >200MB  
**Mitigation:**
- Optimize dependencies if needed
- Accept larger size for MVP
- Can optimize later

**Status:** üü¢ Not a concern

**Overall Risk:** MEDIUM-HIGH - Mitigated with early testing and thorough path resolution

## Hot Tips

### Tip 1: Test Export FIRST
**Why:** Most likely to fail, highest risk  
**How:** Test immediately after packaging

### Tip 2: Log Everything
**Why:** Hard to debug packaged app without logs  
**How:** Add console.log for paths, test with it

### Tip 3: Test on Clean Mac (If Possible)
**Why:** Catches hidden dependencies  
**How:** Copy DMG to different Mac, install fresh

### Tip 4: Document Gatekeeper Bypass
**Why:** Users WILL hit this  
**How:** Make it prominent in README

### Tip 5: Build Early, Test Often
**Why:** Can't fix last-minute packaging issues  
**How:** Test packaging on Day 2 morning

### Tip 6: Keep Build Process Simple
**Why:** Complex configurations break easily  
**How:** Use electron-builder defaults where possible

### Tip 7: Verify FFmpeg Paths with Console Log
**Why:** Most likely failure point  
**How:** Log paths in both dev and production

## Go / No-Go Decision

### Go If:
- ‚úÖ All PRs #1-8 complete (everything works in dev)
- ‚úÖ Can export videos successfully in dev
- ‚úÖ You have 2+ hours available
- ‚úÖ Ready to validate production build
- ‚úÖ Excited to test packaged app

### No-Go If:
- ‚ùå Core features don't work in dev (fix first)
- ‚ùå Export doesn't work in dev (must fix first)
- ‚ùå Less than 1 hour available (won't finish)
- ‚ùå Behind schedule (this is critical)

**Decision Aid:** If you're reading this and dev works perfectly, you MUST do this PR. It's the critical validation.

**You've got this!** üí™

When you double-click your packaged ClipForge app and it launches perfectly, imports a video, plays it, trims it, and exports a beautiful trimmed video - that's the moment you know you've shipped something real. Get that DMG built and test it!
