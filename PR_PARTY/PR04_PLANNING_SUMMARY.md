## What We're Building

### Features

| Feature | Time | Priority | Impact |
|---------|------|----------|--------|
| FFmpeg Integration | 1h | CRITICAL | Foundation for export |
| IPC Communication | 1h | CRITICAL | Connect renderer to FFmpeg |
| Export UI Component | 1h | HIGH | User can trigger export |
| End-to-End Testing | 1h | CRITICAL | Verify it actually works |

**Total Time:** 4 hours

### What This Enables
- ✅ Export edited videos to MP4
- ✅ Save user's work
- ✅ Validate entire editing pipeline
- ✅ Foundation for trim functionality (PR #6)

---

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Use fluent-ffmpeg (JavaScript Wrapper)
**Choice:** Use fluent-ffmpeg instead of direct FFmpeg CLI  
**Rationale:** Simpler API, handles binary paths, built-in progress reporting  
**Impact:** Faster development, less code, easier debugging  
**File:** `electron/ffmpeg/videoProcessing.js`

### Decision 2: Bundle Static Binaries
**Choice:** Use ffmpeg-static and ffprobe-static packages  
**Rationale:** Better UX (works out of box), reliable in packaged app  
**Impact:** Larger app size (~60MB) but zero user hassle  
**Packages:** `ffmpeg-static@5.2.0`, `ffprobe-static@3.1.0`

### Decision 3: Run in Main Process
**Choice:** Execute FFmpeg operations in Electron main process  
**Rationale:** Full Node.js file system access, cleaner IPC  
**Impact:** Requires proper async handling to avoid blocking  
**Pattern:** IPC events for progress updates

### Decision 4: Real-Time Progress Updates
**Choice:** Implement IPC progress events  
**Rationale:** Better UX, shows user export is working  
**Impact:** Some IPC complexity but professional feel  
**Implementation:** `onProgress` callback → IPC → renderer state update

## Implementation Strategy

### Timeline

```
Hour 1: FFmpeg Setup
├─ Install dependencies (5 min)
├─ Create videoProcessing.js (30 min)
└─ Test basic export (25 min)

Hour 2: IPC Integration
├─ Add IPC handlers to main.js (30 min)
├─ Expose API in preload.js (20 min)
└─ Test IPC communication (10 min)

Hour 3: Export UI
├─ Create ExportPanel component (40 min)
└─ Add styling (20 min)

Hour 4: Integration & Testing
├─ Integrate into App.js (15 min)
├─ Manual testing (30 min)
└─ Final verification (15 min)
```

### Key Principle
**Test FFmpeg working FIRST (Hour 1) before building UI around it. Don't build beautiful UI if export doesn't work.**

---

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- Export completes in <2x video duration
- Progress updates every 1-2 seconds
- Memory usage stable during export

### Qualitative
- Export button clearly visible
- Progress bar smooth and responsive
- Success message clear and informative
- Error messages helpful and actionable

## Risks Identified & Mitigated

### Risk 1: FFmpeg Binary Path Issues 🟡 MEDIUM
**Issue:** FFmpeg not found in packaged app  
**Mitigation:** Use ffmpeg-static to handle path resolution automatically  
**Status:** Documented, will test in PR #9

### Risk 2: Export Blocking UI 🟢 LOW
**Issue:** UI freezes during long export  
**Mitigation:** Async callbacks with progress updates  
**Status:** Pattern implemented, will verify during testing

### Risk 3: Invalid Output Files 🟢 LOW
**Issue:** Exported video won't play  
**Mitigation:** Use standard codecs (H.264, AAC), comprehensive error handling  
**Status:** Tested settings, will verify with actual files

### Risk 4: Memory with Large Videos 🟡 MEDIUM
**Issue:** Memory exhaustion with huge files  
**Mitigation:** Monitor usage, test with large files, add limits if needed  
**Status:** Will monitor during Hour 4 testing

**Overall Risk:** 🟡 MEDIUM - Critical feature but mitigation strategies solid

## Hot Tips

### Tip 1: Test FFmpeg Working BEFORE Building UI
**Why:** If FFmpeg doesn't work, no amount of beautiful UI fixes it. Validate the foundation first.

### Tip 2: Use Console Logging Liberally
**Why:** IPC debugging is hard. Log every step: "Export started", "Progress: 45%", "Export complete".

### Tip 3: Test with Actual Video Files
**Why:** Synthetic tests don't catch codec issues. Always test with real MP4s.

### Tip 4: Monitor Memory During Testing
**Why:** Large video exports can exhaust memory. Catch this early, not in production.

## Go / No-Go Decision

### Go If:
- ✅ PR #1, #2, #3 complete (foundation in place)
- ✅ 4 hours available (minimum needed)
- ✅ FFmpeg knowledge or willingness to learn
- ✅ Test MP4 files ready for testing

### No-Go If:
- ❌ Import/video player not working (can't test export without clips)
- ❌ Less than 4 hours available (can't rush this critical feature)
- ❌ No FFmpeg knowledge and no time to learn

### Decision Aid
**This is the highest-risk, highest-value feature in the MVP.** If export doesn't work by end of Day 1, the entire editing pipeline is worthless. However, with good planning (which we have) and following the checklist step-by-step, it's absolutely doable in 4 hours.

**Recommendation:** GO if dependencies are met. Defer only if PRs #1-3 aren't complete.

## Immediate Next Actions

### Pre-Flight (5 minutes)
- [ ] Prerequisites checked (PRs #1-3 complete)
- [ ] Dependencies ready to install
- [ ] Test MP4 file ready
- [ ] Git branch: `git checkout -b feat/ffmpeg-export`

### Hour 1 Goals
- [ ] Install npm packages
- [ ] Create videoProcessing.js
- [ ] Test basic export works
- [ ] **Checkpoint:** Can export video from terminal

### Hour 2-3: Build the UI
- [ ] Add IPC handlers
- [ ] Create ExportPanel component
- [ ] Integrate into app
- [ ] **Checkpoint:** Export button triggers export

### Hour 4: Test Everything
- [ ] Test full workflow
- [ ] Verify output files
- [ ] Check performance
- [ ] **Checkpoint:** Working export end-to-end

## Conclusion

**Planning Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Confidence Level:** HIGH  
**Recommendation:** BUILD IMMEDIATELY (if PRs #1-3 done)

This is the most important Day 1 feature. The architecture is sound, the plan is detailed, and the risk mitigation is solid. Follow the checklist step-by-step, test as you go, and you'll have working export in 4 hours.

**Next Step:** When ready, start with Phase 1 from checklist.

---

**You've got this!** 💪

You're building the feature that makes all the editing work meaningful - the ability to save and share your edited video. The architecture is proven (FFmpeg + Electron), the patterns are established (IPC + React), and you have a detailed road map.

Don't skip testing in Hour 1. That's when you catch FFmpeg issues early, before you've built UI around broken export.
