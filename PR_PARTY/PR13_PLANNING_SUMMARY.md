## What We're Building

### [3] Major Phases

| Phase | Features | Time | Priority | Impact |
|-------|----------|------|----------|--------|
| Phase 1: Core Foundation | Enhanced Context, Timeline Calculations, Basic Structure | 8-10h | HIGH | Foundation for all other features |
| Phase 2: Multi-Track System | Track Components, Clip Components, Track Types | 8-10h | HIGH | Professional multi-track editing |
| Phase 3: Advanced Manipulation | Edge Trimming, Clip Operations, Magnetic Timeline | 8-12h | HIGH | Industry-standard editing tools |

**Total Time:** 24-32 hours

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Complete Timeline Replacement
**Choice:** Replace current timeline entirely with professional implementation  
**Rationale:**
- Current timeline is basic and limited
- Professional features require new architecture
- Better to build right than patch existing system
- Users expect modern video editing capabilities

**Impact:** Major architectural change but enables professional features

### Decision 2: Magnetic Timeline System
**Choice:** Implement magnetic snapping with manual override  
**Rationale:**
- Provides professional feel while maintaining user control
- Prevents gaps and maintains sync
- Familiar to users from CapCut/iMovie
- Allows precision when needed

**Impact:** Intuitive workflow with gap prevention

### Decision 3: Edge-Based Trimming
**Choice:** Drag clip edges to trim (CapCut style)  
**Rationale:**
- Most intuitive for users
- Industry standard approach
- Allows for precise control
- Familiar interaction pattern

**Impact:** Intuitive trimming experience

### Decision 4: Multi-Track Architecture
**Choice:** Multiple independent tracks with track types  
**Rationale:**
- Clear separation of content types
- Scalable for future features
- Industry standard approach
- Easier to implement initially

**Impact:** Professional multi-track editing capabilities

## Implementation Strategy

### Timeline
```
Week 1:
├─ Day 1: Phase 1 - Core Foundation (8-10h)
├─ Day 2: Phase 2 - Multi-Track System (8-10h)
└─ Day 3: Phase 3 - Advanced Manipulation (8-12h)
```

### Key Principle
**"Build the foundation right, then add features."** Start with solid architecture, then add professional features.

---

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- [ ] Timeline rendering: < 16ms (60fps)
- [ ] Clip operations: < 100ms response time
- [ ] Memory usage: < 200MB for 100 clips
- [ ] Zero critical bugs

### Qualitative
- [ ] Timeline feels professional and responsive
- [ ] Users can intuitively edit videos
- [ ] Features match industry standards
- [ ] Smooth and enjoyable editing experience

## Risks Identified & Mitigated

### Risk 1: Performance with Large Projects 🟡 MEDIUM
**Issue:** Timeline may become slow with many clips  
**Mitigation:** Implement virtual scrolling, lazy loading, and performance monitoring  
**Status:** Documented with specific solutions

### Risk 2: Complex State Management 🟡 MEDIUM
**Issue:** Multi-track state can become complex  
**Mitigation:** Use proven reducer patterns, extensive testing, incremental implementation  
**Status:** Documented with code examples

### Risk 3: Magnetic Snap Complexity 🟡 MEDIUM
**Issue:** Snap logic can be tricky to implement correctly  
**Mitigation:** Start with simple snap logic, iterate based on user feedback  
**Status:** Documented with implementation details

### Risk 4: Browser Compatibility 🟢 LOW
**Issue:** Advanced features may not work on all browsers  
**Mitigation:** Test on multiple browsers, use standard APIs  
**Status:** Low risk, standard web APIs used

**Overall Risk:** MEDIUM - Well-documented risks with mitigation strategies

## Hot Tips

### Tip 1: Start with Context Enhancement
**Why:** The enhanced TimelineContext is the foundation for everything else. Get this right first.

### Tip 2: Implement Calculations Early
**Why:** Timeline calculations are used everywhere. Implement and test these utilities thoroughly.

### Tip 3: Test Each Phase Independently
**Why:** Each phase builds on the previous one. Make sure each phase works before moving to the next.

### Tip 4: Use React.memo for Performance
**Why:** Clip components will re-render frequently. Memoize them for better performance.

### Tip 5: Implement Undo/Redo Early
**Why:** Much easier to implement with the state structure than to add later.

## Go / No-Go Decision

### Go If:
- ✅ You have 24+ hours available
- ✅ Current timeline is stable and backed up
- ✅ You want professional-grade video editing
- ✅ You're ready for major architectural changes
- ✅ You understand the scope and complexity

### No-Go If:
- ❌ Time-constrained (<24 hours)
- ❌ Current timeline works well enough
- ❌ Prefer incremental improvements
- ❌ Not comfortable with major changes
- ❌ Other priorities take precedence

**Decision Aid:** This is a major feature that will significantly improve user experience but requires substantial time investment. Only proceed if you're committed to the full implementation.

## Immediate Next Actions

### Pre-Flight (5 minutes)
- [ ] Backup current timeline implementation
- [ ] Create feature branch
- [ ] Verify development environment

### Day 1 Goals (8-10 hours)
- [ ] Read full specification (45 min)
- [ ] Set up environment (15 min)
- [ ] Start Phase 1: Enhanced Timeline Context (2-3h)
- [ ] Implement Timeline Calculations (2-3h)
- [ ] Create Basic Timeline Structure (3-4h)

**Checkpoint:** Core timeline foundation working

## Conclusion

**Planning Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Confidence Level:** HIGH  
**Recommendation:** Build it! This will transform ClipForge into a professional video editor.

**Next Step:** When ready, start with Phase 1: Core Timeline Foundation.

---

**You've got this!** 💪

This is a major step forward for ClipForge. A professional timeline will make users feel like they're using industry-standard software and enable advanced editing workflows. The planning is comprehensive and detailed - you have everything you need to succeed.
