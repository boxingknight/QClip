## What We're Building

### Destructive Trim Features

| Feature | Time | Priority | Impact |
|---------|------|----------|--------|
| Apply Trim button UI | 30 min | HIGH | Clear workflow |
| Render trimmed clip | 2 hours | CRITICAL | Core functionality |
| State update logic | 1 hour | CRITICAL | State consistency |
| Player integration | 30 min | HIGH | Playback accuracy |
| Timeline cleanup | 30 min | HIGH | Visual accuracy |
| Export simplification | 30 min | MEDIUM | Code cleanup |
| Testing & polish | 1 hour | HIGH | Quality assurance |

**Total Time:** 4-6 hours

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Destructive Trim
**Choice:** Permanently trim clips when user applies  
**Rationale:** Most intuitive (iMovie-style), matches user expectations  
**Impact:** Timeline shows actual project, export is predictable

### Decision 2: Render on Confirm
**Choice:** User clicks "Apply Trim" to trigger render  
**Rationale:** Clear intent, can abort if wrong, prevents accidental renders  
**Impact:** Extra click but clearer workflow

### Decision 3: Temp Directory Storage
**Choice:** Store trimmed files in app temp directory  
**Rationale:** Preserves originals, clean structure, easy cleanup  
**Impact:** Disk space management needed

### Decision 4: Draft/Applied States
**Choice:** Show draft marks until applied  
**Rationale:** Visual feedback, can fine-tune before committing  
**Impact:** Two-state system (draft vs applied)

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Workflow Transformation

**Current (PR#6):**
```
Trim marks → Timeline overlay → Export applies trim
```

**New (PR#6.1):**
```
Trim marks → Click Apply → Render → Replace clip → Timeline updated
```

### Key Changes

1. **Render Step:** FFmpeg creates new trimmed file
2. **State Update:** Clip path → trimmed file, duration → trimmed length
3. **Timeline:** No overlays, shows actual duration
4. **Player:** Uses trimmed file, starts at 0:00
5. **Export:** No trim logic (already trimmed)

### Testing Strategy

Test after EACH phase:
1. Phase 1: Button appears and disables correctly
2. Phase 2: Render creates valid file
3. Phase 3: Clip state updates correctly
4. Phase 4: Player shows trimmed clip
5. Phase 5: Timeline shows correct width
6. Phase 6: Export works without trim
7. Phase 7: Complete workflow verified

---

## Success Metrics

**Quantitative:**
- Render time: < 10 seconds for 30s clip
- State updates: Instant (< 100ms)
- File size: Trimmed file ≈ trim duration ratio
- Zero state inconsistencies after apply

**Qualitative:**
- Workflow feels intuitive
- Users say "it just works"
- Matches iMovie behavior
- Visual feedback is clear

## Risks Identified & Mitigated

### Risk 1: Render Performance 🟡 MEDIUM
**Issue:** FFmpeg rendering might be slow  
**Mitigation:** Use ultrafast preset, add progress feedback  
**Status:** Documented in implementation

### Risk 2: Temp File Management 🟡 MEDIUM  
**Issue:** Temp files accumulating  
**Mitigation:** Implement cleanup on exit, track files  
**Status:** Cleanup strategy planned

### Risk 3: State Consistency 🔴 HIGH
**Issue:** State updates might be inconsistent  
**Mitigation:** Careful state management, test thoroughly  
**Status:** Marked as high risk

### Risk 4: Backwards Compatibility 🟢 LOW
**Issue:** Existing clips not trimmed  
**Mitigation:** Existing clips work fine (no change)  
**Status:** Low risk, isolated feature

**Overall Risk:** 🟡 MEDIUM - Manageable with careful testing

## Hot Tips

### Tip 1: Test Render Early
Start with a simple test: manually call renderTrimmedClip with hardcoded values. Verify it works before integrating UI.

### Tip 2: Update State Atomically
Don't update clip state until render completes. Use async/await properly to prevent race conditions.

### Tip 3: Visual Feedback is Critical
Show progress during render. Users need to know something is happening.

### Tip 4: Clean Up on Errors
If render fails, don't leave partial state. Always clean up and show error.

### Tip 5: Test Multi-Clip
Test trimming multiple clips in sequence. State updates across multiple clips should be independent.

## Go / No-Go Decision

### Go If:
- ✅ PR #6 complete (current trim working)
- ✅ You have 4-6 hours available
- ✅ Want iMovie-style intuitive trimming
- ✅ Current non-destructive system is confusing users
- ✅ Comfortable with state refactoring

### No-Go If:
- ❌ PR #6 not complete yet
- ❌ Less than 3 hours available
- ❌ Current system "good enough" for MVP
- ❌ Users happy with current approach
- ❌ Uncomfortable with major refactoring

**Decision Aid:** Only build if current trim system is causing user confusion. Otherwise, ship MVP as-is and enhance later.

## Immediate Next Actions

### Pre-Flight (5 minutes)
- [ ] Verify PR #6 working correctly
- [ ] Review current trim implementation
- [ ] Create feature branch

### Hour 1-2 Goals
- [ ] Add Apply button to UI
- [ ] Create render function stub
- [ ] Test manual render
- [ ] Add IPC handler

### Hour 3-4 Goals  
- [ ] Implement state update logic
- [ ] Integrate with player
- [ ] Update timeline display
- [ ] Test single clip workflow

**Checkpoint:** Single clip destructive trim working ✓

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before (PR#6 - Non-Destructive)
```
Clip: 120s original
Trim marks: 10-40s
Player: Still shows full 0:00-2:00
Timeline: Shows 120s with overlay marks
Export: Applies trim marks
```

### After (PR#6.1 - Destructive)
```
Clip: 120s original
Trim marks: 10-40s
[Click Apply]
Clip: 30s trimmed file
Player: Shows 0:00-0:30 (trimmed)
Timeline: Shows 30s actual width
Export: Uses trimmed file
```

## Conclusion

**Planning Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Confidence Level:** 🟢 HIGH  
**Recommendation:** BUILD IT

This refactor transforms ClipForge from a confusing non-destructive system to an intuitive iMovie-style destructive trim. Users will immediately understand that "trimming" means "cutting." The implementation is well-documented and has clear phases.

**Next Step:** Start with Phase 1 (Apply button) and work through each phase systematically.

---

**You've got this!** 💪

This is the right approach for intuitive video editing. iMovie didn't become popular because it was technically superior—it became popular because it was intuitive. This refactor brings that intuition to ClipForge.

*"Make it work, make it right, make it fast. Done is better than perfect."*
