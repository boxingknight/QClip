### PR#06.1: Destructive Trim ✅ COMPLETE
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Timeline**: 4 hours actual  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Complexity**: MEDIUM  
**Completed**: October 27, 2025  
**Branch**: `feature/pr06-trim-controls`

**What We Built:**
Timeline-based destructive trim system where users trim clips directly on the timeline. All controls consolidated into timeline for professional video editor UX. Trim marks are draft until "Apply Trim" is clicked, which renders a new trimmed file and updates the clip in state.

**Documents Created:**
- `PR06.1_DESTRUCTIVE_TRIM.md` (Technical Specification)
- `PR06.1_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md` (Implementation tasks)
- `PR06.1_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` (Actual implementation summary)
- `PR06.1_README.md` (Quick start guide)
- `PR06.1_PLANNING_SUMMARY.md` (Executive overview)
- `PR06.1_TESTING_GUIDE.md` (Testing strategy)

**Total Documentation**: ~35,000 words

**What Was Actually Built:**
- Interactive timeline trimming (click to set, drag to adjust)
- Draggable IN/OUT handles on green highlight region
- Apply Trim button in timeline header (with progress)
- Reset button to clear trim marks
- FFmpeg rendering creates trimmed file
- State updates to use trimmed file
- Player shows trimmed segment automatically
- Multi-clip export concatenates all clips
- Clean handle release with global mouse listeners

**Key Implementation Decisions:**
- Timeline-based controls (not sidebar) - more professional
- Removed TrimControls component entirely
- Consolidated all trim UI into timeline
- Global mouse listeners for clean drag/release
- IPC-based temp path generation (renderer can't use require)

**Bugs Fixed:**
1. Apply button always disabled → Fixed trim data initialization
2. ReferenceError require → Created IPC handler for paths
3. Sticky trim handles → Added global mouse listeners
4. Trim overlay without handles → Fixed conditional rendering
5. Export only first clip → Implemented FFmpeg concat

## Total Documentation

### Current Stats
- **Files:** 61 documents (MVP + V2 PRs documented)  
- **Words:** ~278,000 words
- **Planning Time:** ~17 hours invested
- **Implementation Time:** ~30 hours (MVP + PR#11 complete)
- **ROI:** Excellent (comprehensive planning prevents bugs)

### Philosophy
**"Plan twice, code once."**

Every hour spent planning saves 3-5 hours of debugging and refactoring. This documentation practice delivers:
- ✅ Clear implementation path
- ✅ Fewer bugs during development
- ✅ Faster decision-making
- ✅ Better knowledge sharing
- ✅ AI-friendly context for future work

---

## Key Decisions Made

### PR #5: Timeline Component
1. **CSS-based blocks** over Canvas rendering (faster MVP)
2. **Duration-based proportional widths** (professional standard)
3. **App-level selection state** (single source of truth)
4. **Auto-select first clip** (better UX)
5. **Horizontal scroll for MVP** (add zoom post-MVP)

See `PR05_PLANNING_SUMMARY.md` for details.

### PR #8: Bug Fixes & Error Handling ✅ COMPLETE
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Timeline:** 4 hours estimated / ~5 hours actual (including fixes)  
**Completed:** October 27, 2025  
**Priority:** Day 2, Hours 31-34  
**Complexity:** MEDIUM  
**Dependencies:** PRs #1-6 (Timeline, Trim)
**Branch:** `fix/error-handling` → merged to `main`

**What We Built:**
Comprehensive error handling and stability improvements across all components. Adds error boundaries, improves error messages, handles edge cases, prevents memory leaks, and adds debugging infrastructure. This is the "cleanup and hardening" PR that makes the app production-ready.

**Key Deliverables:**
- ✅ Logger utility for structured logging (dev/prod modes)
- ✅ ErrorBoundary component to prevent app crashes
- ✅ ErrorFallback UI with reload option
- ✅ Window error handlers for main and renderer
- ✅ Video Player memory leak fixes with proper cleanup
- ✅ Enhanced error handling in ImportPanel, VideoPlayer, ExportPanel
- ✅ Trim validation on apply (preserves original trim functionality)
- ✅ Comprehensive logging throughout app

**Files Created:**
- `src/utils/logger.js` - Structured logging utility
- `src/components/ErrorBoundary.js` - React error boundary
- `src/components/ErrorFallback.js` + CSS - Error UI
- `src/utils/trimValidation.js` - Trim point validation
- `PR_PARTY/PR08_*.md` - Complete documentation (6 documents)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/App.js` - ErrorBoundary + trim validation + logging
- `src/components/ImportPanel.js` - Error handling + logging
- `src/components/VideoPlayer.js` - Memory cleanup + logging
- `src/components/ExportPanel.js` - Logging
- `src/index.js` - Window error handlers
- `main.js` - Process error handlers

**Bugs Fixed During Development:**
1. Trim validation blocking double-click → Fixed by removing validation from setters
2. Duration validation failing initially → Fixed by checking if duration exists
3. Clips showing 0:00 duration → Fixed by calling onTimeUpdate on metadata load

**Documents:**
- `PR08_ERROR_HANDLING.md` (~10,000 words) - Technical specification
- `PR08_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md` (~8,000 words) - Step-by-step tasks
- `PR08_README.md` (~3,000 words) - Quick start guide
- `PR08_PLANNING_SUMMARY.md` (~2,000 words) - Executive overview
- `PR08_TESTING_GUIDE.md` (~4,000 words) - Testing strategy
- `PR08_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md` (~3,000 words) - Completion retrospective

**Total Documentation:** ~30,000 words

**Lessons Learned:**
- Comprehensive planning saves implementation time
- Test UI interactions when adding validation
- Preserve callbacks during refactoring
- Always compare against original working code
- Fix bugs immediately while context is fresh

**Time Breakdown:**
- Planning: 2 hours
- Implementation: 2.5 hours
- Bug fixes: 1.5 hours
- **Total: ~6 hours** (vs 4 estimated)
