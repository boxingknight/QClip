# PR#16: Undo/Redo System - Quick Start

---

## TL;DR (30 seconds)

**What:** Complete undo/redo system for timeline editing operations (drag, split, delete, duplicate)

**Why:** Essential safety net for professional video editing - users can experiment freely knowing they can revert changes

**Time:** 3 hours actual (4 hours estimated)

**Complexity:** MEDIUM

**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE

---

## Decision Framework (2 minutes)

### Should You Build This?

**Green Lights (Build it!):**
- ‚úÖ PR #11-15 complete (dependencies met)
- ‚úÖ 4+ hours available
- ‚úÖ Users need undo/redo for professional editing
- ‚úÖ TimelineContext reducer pattern established

**Red Lights (Skip/defer it!):**
- ‚ùå Timeline operations not yet implemented
- ‚ùå No Context API foundation (PR #11 incomplete)
- ‚ùå Time-constrained (<2 hours available)
- ‚ùå Other priorities more urgent

**Decision Aid:** Undo/redo is essential for professional video editing. If you have the dependencies met and 4 hours available, build it now. It's a foundation feature that enhances all editing operations.

## Prerequisites (5 minutes)

### Required
- [x] PR #11: State Management Refactor (Context API) ‚úÖ
- [x] PR #12: UI Component Library (Toolbar component) ‚úÖ
- [x] PR #13: Multi-Track Timeline (Timeline operations exist) ‚úÖ
- [x] PR #14: Drag & Drop (Drag operations exist) ‚úÖ
- [x] PR #15: Split & Delete (Split/delete operations exist) ‚úÖ

### Dependencies Check
- [x] TimelineContext exists with reducer pattern
- [x] useTimeline hook exists
- [x] Toolbar component exists
- [x] Keyboard shortcuts hook exists

### Setup Commands
```bash
# 1. Verify timeline is working
npm start

# 2. Open timeline in browser

# 3. Create branch (if needed)
git checkout -b feature/pr16-undo-redo
```

## Getting Started (First Hour)

### Step 1: Read Documentation (45 minutes)
- [x] Read this quick start (10 min)
- [x] Read main specification (`PR16_UNDO_REDO_SYSTEM.md`) (35 min)
- [x] Note: State snapshots approach, 50-state limit, manual saveState() calls

### Step 2: Understand Architecture (15 minutes)
- [x] Review TimelineContext reducer pattern
- [x] Understand how state snapshots work
- [x] Check where timeline operations are (drag, split, delete, duplicate)

**Key Understanding:**
- History stored in TimelineContext state
- State snapshots are copies of timeline state (clips, tracks, selection, playhead, zoom)
- saveState() must be called after meaningful operations
- History limited to 50 entries (memory safety)

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Undo Not Working After Drag
**Symptoms:** Dragging a clip then pressing ‚åòZ doesn't undo  
**Cause:** Missing saveState() call after drag end  
**Solution:**
```javascript
// In Clip.js handleDragEnd
const handleDragEnd = () => {
  // ... drag completion logic ...
  saveState(); // ‚Üê Add this
};
```

### Issue 2: Buttons Always Disabled
**Symptoms:** Undo/redo buttons always disabled  
**Cause:** History not being created (saveState() never called)  
**Solution:**
- Verify saveState() is called after operations
- Check TimelineContext history array has entries
- Verify canUndo()/canRedo() functions work

### Issue 3: Memory Leaks
**Symptoms:** App memory grows unbounded with operations  
**Cause:** History limit not working  
**Solution:**
- Verify `slice(-50)` in SAVE_STATE case
- Check history array length stays at 50 max

### Issue 4: State Not Restoring Correctly
**Symptoms:** Undo doesn't fully restore state  
**Cause:** State snapshot not copying all fields  
**Solution:**
```javascript
// Ensure all state fields in snapshot
case 'SAVE_STATE':
  newHistory.push({
    clips: [...state.clips],           // ‚úì
    tracks: [...state.tracks],         // ‚úì
    selection: { ...state.selection }, // ‚úì
    playhead: state.playhead,          // ‚úì
    zoom: state.zoom                   // ‚úì
  });
```

### Issue 5: History Branching Issues
**Symptoms:** After undo then new action, can't redo old actions  
**Cause:** History not sliced correctly before adding new entry  
**Solution:**
```javascript
// Slice at historyIndex before pushing
const newHistory = state.history.slice(0, state.historyIndex + 1);
newHistory.push(newState);
```

## Quick Reference

### Key Files
- `src/context/TimelineContext.js` - History state and reducer actions
- `src/hooks/useTimeline.js` - Exposed undo/redo functions
- `src/hooks/useKeyboardShortcuts.js` - Keyboard shortcuts
- `src/components/ui/Toolbar.js` - Undo/redo buttons
- `src/components/timeline/Clip.js` - Drag operation saveState()
- `src/components/timeline/ClipContextMenu.js` - Menu operation saveState()

### Key Functions
- `saveState()` - Save current state to history
- `undo()` - Revert to previous state
- `redo()` - Restore undone state
- `canUndo()` - Check if undo available
- `canRedo()` - Check if redo available

### Key Concepts
- **State Snapshots:** Full copies of timeline state stored in history
- **History Limit:** 50 entries maximum (prevents memory leaks)
- **Manual Saving:** saveState() called explicitly after operations
- **History Branching:** Undo then new action clears future history

### Useful Commands
```bash
# Run development server
npm start

# Test undo/redo
# 1. Make change (drag, split, delete)
# 2. Press ‚åòZ to undo
# 3. Press ‚åò‚áßZ to redo

# Check memory usage
# Monitor in DevTools Performance tab
```

- [x] Can undo delete operations
- [x] Can undo duplicate operations
- [x] Buttons show correct disabled state

## Help & Support

### Stuck?
1. Check main specification (`PR16_UNDO_REDO_SYSTEM.md`) for architecture details
2. Review similar implementation (PR#15 - Split & Delete) for saveState() patterns
3. Check TimelineContext reducer for existing action patterns
4. Verify saveState() is called after operations

### Want to Skip a Feature?
**Can Skip:**
- History visualization (future PR)
- Persisting history to project files (future PR)
- Undo/redo for trim operations (future PR)

**Must Have:**
- Basic undo/redo for timeline operations
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Toolbar buttons

### Running Out of Time?
**Priority Order:**
1. Reducer actions (SAVE_STATE, UNDO, REDO) - Core functionality
2. Context functions (saveState, undo, redo) - API
3. Keyboard shortcuts - User convenience
4. Toolbar buttons - Nice to have

**Minimum Viable:**
- Reducer actions working
- Keyboard shortcuts working
- Basic integration complete

## Motivation

**You've got this!** üí™

Undo/redo is a fundamental feature that users expect in professional editors. The implementation is straightforward with state snapshots - simpler than inverse operations. With TimelineContext already established, adding history is just another reducer case. This PR transforms ClipForge into a professional editor where users can experiment freely.

**Why It Matters:**
- Users need confidence to try edits
- Professional editors require undo/redo
- State snapshots are simpler than command pattern
- Foundation for advanced features (project files, auto-save)

## Next Steps

**When ready:**
1. Read main specification (45 min)
2. Review TimelineContext reducer (15 min)
3. Start Phase 1 from checklist (history state)
4. Commit when phases complete

**Status:** Ready to implement! üöÄ

## Implementation Summary

**What Was Built:**
- ‚úÖ State snapshot history in TimelineContext
- ‚úÖ SAVE_STATE, UNDO, REDO reducer actions
- ‚úÖ saveState(), undo(), redo() functions
- ‚úÖ Keyboard shortcuts (‚åòZ, ‚åò‚áßZ, ‚åòY)
- ‚úÖ Toolbar buttons with disabled states
- ‚úÖ Integration with all timeline operations

**Time Taken:** 3 hours (under 4 hour estimate)

**Result:** Professional undo/redo system with keyboard shortcuts and UI controls
