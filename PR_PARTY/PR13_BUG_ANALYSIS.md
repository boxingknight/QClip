## Bug #1: MediaLibrary Context Disconnect

**Severity:** 🟡 HIGH  
**Time to Find:** 5 minutes  
**Time to Fix:** 30 minutes  
**Impact:** Media Library showed "No videos imported yet" despite clips being in timeline

### The Issue

**What Went Wrong:**
The MediaLibrary component was reading from `ProjectContext` while the ImportPanel was adding clips to `TimelineContext`, creating a data disconnect.

**Error Message:**
```
No videos imported yet
```

**User Impact:**
- Users couldn't see imported videos in the media library
- Confusion about whether videos were actually imported
- Inconsistent UI state

### Root Cause Analysis

**Surface Issue:**
MediaLibrary showing empty state despite clips existing

**Actual Cause:**
Context mismatch - ImportPanel used TimelineContext, MediaLibrary used ProjectContext

**Why It Matters:**
React Context API requires consistent usage across components for proper data flow

### The Fix

**Before (Broken):**
```javascript
// MediaLibrary.js - Reading from wrong context
const { clips } = useProject();

// ImportPanel.js - Adding to different context
const { addClips } = useTimeline();
```

**After (Fixed):**
```javascript
// MediaLibrary.js - Now using correct context
const { clips } = useTimeline();

// ImportPanel.js - Consistent context usage
const { addClips } = useTimeline();
```

### Files Changed
- `src/components/MediaLibrary.js` (+5/-5 lines)

### Commit
`fix(context): resolve MediaLibrary context disconnect`
Hash: `[commit hash]`

### Prevention Strategy

**How to Avoid This in Future:**
1. Document which context each component should use
2. Use TypeScript to enforce context usage
3. Create context usage guidelines

**Test to Add:**
```javascript
it('should show imported clips in media library', () => {
  // Test that MediaLibrary displays clips from TimelineContext
});
```

## Bug #2: Missing Video Metadata

**Severity:** 🟡 HIGH  
**Time to Find:** 10 minutes  
**Time to Fix:** 45 minutes  
**Impact:** Clips showed "0 Bytes" and "Unknown" for all metadata fields

### The Issue

**What Went Wrong:**
Clips were imported without extracting video metadata (duration, resolution, file size, codec).

**Error Message:**
```
0 Bytes
Unknown
Unknown
```

**User Impact:**
- No way to see video duration or resolution
- Clips appeared broken or incomplete
- Poor user experience

### Root Cause Analysis

**Surface Issue:**
Missing metadata display

**Actual Cause:**
No metadata extraction during import process

**Why It Matters:**
Video metadata is essential for professional video editing workflows

### The Fix

**Before (Broken):**
```javascript
// ImportPanel.js - Basic clip creation
const newClip = {
  id: generateId(),
  name: file.name,
  path: file.path
  // Missing: duration, width, height, fps, codec, fileSize
};
```

**After (Fixed):**
```javascript
// ImportPanel.js - Rich metadata extraction
const metadata = await extractVideoMetadata(file.path);
const newClip = {
  id: generateId(),
  name: file.name,
  path: file.path,
  duration: metadata.duration,
  width: metadata.width,
  height: metadata.height,
  fps: metadata.fps,
  codec: metadata.codec,
  hasAudio: metadata.hasAudio,
  fileSize: metadata.fileSize,
  thumbnailUrl: metadata.thumbnailUrl
};
```

### Files Changed
- `src/components/ImportPanel.js` (+50/-10 lines)
- `src/utils/videoMetadata.js` (+150 lines) - New file
- `electron/ffmpeg/videoProcessing.js` (+50/-10 lines)
- `main.js` (+20/-5 lines)
- `preload.js` (+15/-5 lines)

### Commit
`fix(metadata): implement video metadata extraction`

### Prevention Strategy

**How to Avoid This in Future:**
1. Always extract metadata during import
2. Use FFprobe for reliable metadata extraction
3. Provide fallback values for missing metadata

**Test to Add:**
```javascript
it('should extract video metadata during import', async () => {
  const metadata = await extractVideoMetadata(testVideoPath);
  expect(metadata.duration).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  expect(metadata.width).toBeGreaterThan(0);
});
```

## Bug #3: addClip Function Signature Mismatch

**Severity:** 🟠 MEDIUM  
**Time to Find:** 5 minutes  
**Time to Fix:** 20 minutes  
**Impact:** Drag-and-drop from media library failed with "addClip is not a function"

### The Issue

**What Went Wrong:**
Track.js was calling `addClip(timelineClip)` but the function expected `addClip(trackId, timelineClip)`.

**Error Message:**
```
addClip is not a function
```

**User Impact:**
- Drag-and-drop from media library didn't work
- Users couldn't add clips to timeline tracks

### Root Cause Analysis

**Surface Issue:**
Function call error

**Actual Cause:**
Incorrect function signature in Track.js

**Why It Matters:**
Function signatures must match their definitions for proper execution

### The Fix

**Before (Broken):**
```javascript
// Track.js - Wrong function call
const handleDrop = (e) => {
  const timelineClip = createTimelineClip(droppedClip);
  addClip(timelineClip); // ❌ Missing trackId parameter
};
```

**After (Fixed):**
```javascript
// Track.js - Correct function call
const handleDrop = (e) => {
  const timelineClip = createTimelineClip(droppedClip);
  addClip(track.id, timelineClip); // ✅ Correct signature
};
```

### Files Changed
- `src/components/timeline/Track.js` (+2/-2 lines)

### Commit
`fix(timeline): correct addClip function signature`

### Prevention Strategy

**How to Avoid This in Future:**
1. Use TypeScript for function signature validation
2. Document function signatures clearly
3. Use IDE autocomplete for function calls

**Test to Add:**
```javascript
it('should add clip to track with correct parameters', () => {
  const trackId = 'track-1';
  const clip = { id: 'clip-1', name: 'test' };
  expect(() => addClip(trackId, clip)).not.toThrow();
});
```

## Bug #4: Missing Electron IPC Handler

**Severity:** 🟡 HIGH  
**Time to Find:** 10 minutes  
**Time to Fix:** 30 minutes  
**Impact:** Video metadata extraction failed with "getVideoMetadata is not a function"

### The Issue

**What Went Wrong:**
The `getVideoMetadata` function was implemented in the main process but not exposed to the renderer process.

**Error Message:**
```
window.electronAPI.getVideoMetadata is not a function
```

**User Impact:**
- Video metadata extraction completely failed
- Clips imported without any metadata
- Broken import functionality

### Root Cause Analysis

**Surface Issue:**
Function not available in renderer

**Actual Cause:**
Missing IPC handler and preload exposure

**Why It Matters:**
Electron requires explicit IPC setup for main-renderer communication

### The Fix

**Before (Broken):**
```javascript
// main.js - Function exists but not exposed
const { getVideoMetadata } = require('./electron/ffmpeg/videoProcessing');

// preload.js - Function not exposed
contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld('electronAPI', {
  // getVideoMetadata missing
});
```

**After (Fixed):**
```javascript
// main.js - Added IPC handler
ipcMain.handle('get-video-metadata', async (event, videoPath) => {
  return await getVideoMetadata(videoPath);
});

// preload.js - Exposed function
contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld('electronAPI', {
  getVideoMetadata: (videoPath) => ipcRenderer.invoke('get-video-metadata', videoPath)
});
```

### Files Changed
- `main.js` (+8/-2 lines)
- `preload.js` (+3/-1 lines)

### Commit
`fix(electron): add getVideoMetadata IPC handler`

### Prevention Strategy

**How to Avoid This in Future:**
1. Document all IPC functions
2. Create IPC function registry
3. Test IPC functions during development

**Test to Add:**
```javascript
it('should expose getVideoMetadata to renderer', () => {
  expect(window.electronAPI.getVideoMetadata).toBeDefined();
  expect(typeof window.electronAPI.getVideoMetadata).toBe('function');
});
```

## Bug #5: Duplicate SELECT_CLIP Reducer

**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Time to Find:** 45 minutes  
**Time to Fix:** 1 hour  
**Impact:** Video playback completely broken - clips couldn't be selected

### The Issue

**What Went Wrong:**
There were two `SELECT_CLIP` reducer cases in TimelineContext.js - an old-style one that was preventing the new-style one from executing.

**Error Message:**
```
No video selected
undefined
```

**User Impact:**
- Video player showed "No video selected" despite clips being imported
- Clicking clips didn't select them
- Complete breakdown of video playback

### Root Cause Analysis

**Surface Issue:**
Video selection not working

**Actual Cause:**
Duplicate reducer case preventing correct selection logic

**Why It Matters:**
JavaScript object literals can't have duplicate keys - the second one overwrites the first

### The Fix

**Before (Broken):**
```javascript
// TimelineContext.js - Duplicate reducer cases
const timelineReducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'SELECT_CLIP':
      return {
        ...state,
        selectedClipId: action.clipId  // ❌ Old-style (line ~159)
      };
    // ... other cases
    case 'SELECT_CLIP':
      return {
        ...state,
        selection: {
          ...state.selection,
          clips: [action.clipId]  // ✅ New-style (line ~410) - Never executed!
        }
      };
  }
};
```

**After (Fixed):**
```javascript
// TimelineContext.js - Single correct reducer case
const timelineReducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    // ... other cases
    case 'SELECT_CLIP':
      return {
        ...state,
        selection: {
          ...state.selection,
          clips: [action.clipId]  // ✅ Only this one exists now
        }
      };
  }
};
```

### Files Changed
- `src/context/TimelineContext.js` (+0/-15 lines) - Removed duplicate

### Commit
`fix(context): remove duplicate SELECT_CLIP reducer case`

### Prevention Strategy

**How to Avoid This in Future:**
1. Use ESLint rule to detect duplicate object keys
2. Code review process for reducer changes
3. Unit tests for reducer behavior

**Test to Add:**
```javascript
it('should select clip correctly', () => {
  const state = timelineReducer(initialState, { type: 'SELECT_CLIP', clipId: 'clip-1' });
  expect(state.selection.clips).toEqual(['clip-1']);
});
```

## Bug #6: Selection State Mismatch

**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Time to Find:** 30 minutes  
**Time to Fix:** 45 minutes  
**Impact:** First imported clip wasn't automatically selected

### The Issue

**What Went Wrong:**
The `ADD_CLIPS` reducer wasn't updating the `selection.clips` array when new clips were added.

**Error Message:**
```
No video selected
```

**User Impact:**
- Imported clips weren't automatically selected
- Users had to manually click clips to select them
- Poor user experience

### Root Cause Analysis

**Surface Issue:**
Clips not selected after import

**Actual Cause:**
ADD_CLIPS reducer not updating selection state

**Why It Matters:**
Users expect the first imported clip to be automatically selected for immediate playback

### The Fix

**Before (Broken):**
```javascript
// TimelineContext.js - ADD_CLIPS not updating selection
case 'ADD_CLIPS':
  return {
    ...state,
    clips: [...state.clips, ...action.clips]
    // ❌ Missing: selection update
  };
```

**After (Fixed):**
```javascript
// TimelineContext.js - ADD_CLIPS updates selection
case 'ADD_CLIPS':
  return {
    ...state,
    clips: [...state.clips, ...action.clips],
    selection: {
      ...state.selection,
      clips: action.clips.length > 0 ? [action.clips[0].id] : state.selection.clips
    }
  };
```

### Files Changed
- `src/context/TimelineContext.js` (+5/-2 lines)

### Commit
`fix(context): update selection state when adding clips`

### Prevention Strategy

**How to Avoid This in Future:**
1. Always update related state when adding data
2. Test state transitions comprehensively
3. Document state update requirements

**Test to Add:**
```javascript
it('should select first clip when adding clips', () => {
  const clips = [{ id: 'clip-1' }, { id: 'clip-2' }];
  const state = timelineReducer(initialState, { type: 'ADD_CLIPS', clips });
  expect(state.selection.clips).toEqual(['clip-1']);
});
```

## Bug #7: Video Element Registration Timing

**Severity:** 🟡 HIGH  
**Time to Find:** 20 minutes  
**Time to Fix:** 30 minutes  
**Impact:** Playback buttons didn't work - "No video element registered"

### The Issue

**What Went Wrong:**
PlaybackContext wasn't receiving the video element when the video source changed.

**Error Message:**
```
Playback: No video element registered
```

**User Impact:**
- Play/pause buttons didn't work
- Timeline controls were non-functional
- Broken playback experience

### Root Cause Analysis

**Surface Issue:**
Playback buttons not working

**Actual Cause:**
Video element not re-registered when videoSrc changed

**Why It Matters:**
PlaybackContext needs the actual video element to control playback

### The Fix

**Before (Broken):**
```javascript
// VideoPlayer.js - Missing dependency
useEffect(() => {
  if (videoRef.current) {
    registerVideo(videoRef.current);
  }
}, []); // ❌ Missing videoSrc dependency
```

**After (Fixed):**
```javascript
// VideoPlayer.js - Correct dependencies
useEffect(() => {
  if (videoRef.current) {
    registerVideo(videoRef.current);
  }
}, [videoSrc, registerVideo]); // ✅ Re-register when video changes
```

### Files Changed
- `src/components/VideoPlayer.js` (+2/-1 lines)

### Commit
`fix(playback): re-register video element when source changes`

### Prevention Strategy

**How to Avoid This in Future:**
1. Always include all dependencies in useEffect
2. Use ESLint exhaustive-deps rule
3. Test component re-mounting scenarios

**Test to Add:**
```javascript
it('should re-register video when source changes', () => {
  const { rerender } = render(<VideoPlayer videoSrc="video1.mp4" />);
  rerender(<VideoPlayer videoSrc="video2.mp4" />);
  expect(registerVideo).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(2);
});
```

## Bug #8: Playhead Scrubbing Not Synchronized

**Severity:** 🟠 MEDIUM  
**Time to Find:** 10 minutes  
**Time to Fix:** 20 minutes  
**Impact:** Dragging timeline playhead didn't seek the video

### The Issue

**What Went Wrong:**
The Playhead component wasn't calling the `seek` function from PlaybackContext when dragged.

**Error Message:**
No error - silent failure

**User Impact:**
- Timeline scrubbing didn't work
- Users couldn't manually seek through video
- Poor timeline interaction

### Root Cause Analysis

**Surface Issue:**
Playhead dragging not working

**Actual Cause:**
Playhead component not integrated with PlaybackContext

**Why It Matters:**
Timeline scrubbing is a core video editing feature

### The Fix

**Before (Broken):**
```javascript
// Playhead.js - Not using PlaybackContext
const Playhead = ({ position, onSeek }) => {
  const handleMouseMove = (e) => {
    const newTime = calculateTimeFromPosition(e.clientX);
    onSeek?.(newTime); // ❌ Not connected to video
  };
};
```

**After (Fixed):**
```javascript
// Playhead.js - Integrated with PlaybackContext
const Playhead = ({ position }) => {
  const { seek } = usePlayback();
  
  const handleMouseMove = (e) => {
    const newTime = calculateTimeFromPosition(e.clientX);
    seek(newTime); // ✅ Directly controls video
  };
};
```

### Files Changed
- `src/components/timeline/Playhead.js` (+5/-3 lines)

### Commit
`fix(timeline): integrate playhead with PlaybackContext`

### Prevention Strategy

**How to Avoid This in Future:**
1. Always integrate timeline components with playback system
2. Test timeline interactions thoroughly
3. Document component integration requirements

**Test to Add:**
```javascript
it('should seek video when playhead is dragged', () => {
  const { getByTestId } = render(<Playhead position={10} />);
  fireEvent.mouseMove(getByTestId('playhead'), { clientX: 200 });
  expect(seek).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expect.any(Number));
});
```

## Bug #9: Magnetic Snap Pixel-to-Time Conversion Error (THE SMOKING GUN!)

**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Time to Debug:** 4 hours  
**Time to Fix:** 30 minutes  
**Impact:** Trimming was completely non-functional - clips appeared "stuck" and couldn't be shortened

### The Issue

**What Went Wrong:**
When trimming clips with magnetic snap enabled, clips would appear to be "stuck" at their original length and couldn't be shortened, even though console logs showed trimming was being triggered.

**Console Evidence:**
```
[STEP 1] newTrimOut_calculated: 28.204 (correct - seconds)
[STEP 2] afterSnap: 2820.4 (BUG! - treated pixels as seconds)
[STEP 4] afterSecondClamp: 29.134 (clamped back, appearing 'stuck')
```

**User Impact:**
- Trimming handles wouldn't respond to user input
- Clips couldn't be shortened from edges
- Professional video editing workflow was impossible
- Users couldn't create seamless movie sequences

### Root Cause Analysis

**Surface Issue:**
Trimming appeared to be "stuck" and non-responsive.

**Actual Cause:**
**PIXEL-TO-TIME UNIT MISMATCH** in magnetic snap logic! The `snapToNearest()` function returns **pixels**, but we were treating the result as **seconds**, causing a 100x multiplication error.

**The Bug Sequence:**
1. User drags trim handle left by 3.53 seconds
2. `deltaTime = -3.53` (correct)
3. `newTrimOut = 29.134 + (-3.53) = 25.6` (correct)
4. `timeToPixels(25.6, zoom) = 2560px` (correct)
5. `snapToNearest(2560px) = 2820px` (correct - returns pixels)
6. **BUG:** `newTrimOut = 2820` (treated pixels as seconds!)
7. Clamp: `Math.min(2820, 29.134) = 29.134` (back to original)

**Why It Mattered:**
This was the most subtle and devastating bug - the trimming logic was mathematically correct, but a unit conversion error made it appear completely broken.

### The Fix

**Before (Broken):**
```javascript
// Clip.js - WRONG: Treating pixels as seconds
if (magneticSnap) {
  const newTrimOutPx = timeToPixels(newTrimOut, zoom);
  newTrimOut = snapToNearest(newTrimOutPx, clip.id); // ❌ Returns pixels, treated as seconds!
}
```

**After (Fixed):**
```javascript
// Clip.js - CORRECT: Convert pixels back to seconds
if (magneticSnap) {
  const newTrimOutPx = timeToPixels(newTrimOut, zoom);
  const snappedPx = snapToNearest(newTrimOutPx, clip.id); // Get pixels
  newTrimOut = pixelsToTime(snappedPx, zoom); // ✅ Convert back to seconds!
}
```

### Files Changed
- `src/components/timeline/Clip.js` (+8/-4 lines)

### Commit
`fix(CRITICAL): pixel-to-time conversion bug in magnetic snap trimming`
Hash: `98ba2ab`

### Prevention Strategy

**How to Avoid This in Future:**
1. **Always verify unit types** in conversion functions
2. **Add unit comments** to variables: `const timeInSeconds = ...`
3. **Test magnetic snap** with detailed logging during development
4. **Validate conversion chains**: `seconds → pixels → snap → pixels → seconds`

**Test to Add:**
```javascript
it('should maintain correct units through magnetic snap conversion', () => {
  const originalTime = 25.6; // seconds
  const pixels = timeToPixels(originalTime, zoom);
  const snappedPixels = snapToNearest(pixels, clipId);
  const finalTime = pixelsToTime(snappedPixels, zoom);
  
  // Verify we end up with seconds, not pixels
  expect(finalTime).toBeLessThan(1000); // Should be seconds, not pixels
});
```

**Linting Rule:**
Consider adding ESLint rules to flag potential unit mismatches in conversion functions.

## Bug #10: Player/Export Disconnect from Timeline State

**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Time to Identify:** 30 minutes  
**Time to Fix:** 2 hours  
**Impact:** Player and export ignored timeline trims - complete WYSIWYG workflow failure

### The Issue

**What Went Wrong:**
After trimming a clip on the timeline (e.g., 10s-20s portion of a 30s video), the video player would still play the full 30s video, and export would render the full 30s, completely ignoring the visual timeline state.

**User Impact:**
- User trims clip to 10s but export renders 30s full video
- Player plays full video regardless of timeline trim
- No correlation between timeline visual and actual output
- Professional workflow completely broken
- WYSIWYG principle violated

### Root Cause Analysis

**Surface Issue:**
Timeline trims appeared to be cosmetic only.

**Actual Cause:**
**TWO DISCONNECTS** between timeline state and playback/export systems:

1. **VideoPlayer Disconnect:** Player received `selectedClip.path` (original file) but never respected `trimIn`/`trimOut` bounds during playback
2. **Export Format Mismatch:** Timeline stored `trimIn`/`trimOut` on clips, but export expected separate `clipTrims` object with `inPoint`/`outPoint` keys

**Why It Mattered:**
Without this synchronization, ClipForge was just a video viewer with decorative timeline markers - not a real editor.

### The Fix

**Player Solution (VideoPlayer.js):**
```javascript
// ✅ AFTER: Trim-aware playback
const handleLoadedMetadata = () => {
  // Seek to trimIn on load
  const trimIn = selectedClip?.trimIn || 0;
  if (trimIn > 0) {
    video.currentTime = trimIn;
  }
};

// Stop at trimOut during playback
onTimeUpdate={() => {
  const trimOut = selectedClip?.trimOut || duration;
  if (current >= trimOut) {
    video.pause();
    setIsPlaying(false);
  }
});

// Loop to trimIn on replay
const handlePlayPause = () => {
  if (!isPlaying) {
    const trimOut = selectedClip?.trimOut || duration;
    const trimIn = selectedClip?.trimIn || 0;
    if (video.currentTime >= trimOut) {
      video.currentTime = trimIn;
    }
  }
};
```

**Export Solution (ExportPanel.js):**
```javascript
// ✅ AFTER: Convert timeline format to export format
const clipTrimsForExport = {};
allClips.forEach(clip => {
  clipTrimsForExport[clip.id] = {
    inPoint: clip.trimIn || 0,
    outPoint: clip.trimOut || clip.duration
  };
});

// Export with converted trim data
await window.electronAPI.exportTimeline(
  allClips,
  clipTrimsForExport,
  outputPath
);
```

### Files Changed
- `src/components/VideoPlayer.js` (+30/-5 lines)
- `src/components/ExportPanel.js` (+17/-1 lines)

### Commit
`feat(player): sync video playback with timeline trim bounds`
`feat(export): sync export with timeline trim state`

### Prevention Strategy

**How to Avoid This in Future:**
1. **E2E Testing:** Test playback after every timeline operation
2. **Data Format Documentation:** Document expected formats for all IPC calls
3. **Integration Tests:** Test VideoPlayer with trimmed clips
4. **Export Tests:** Verify exported duration matches timeline
5. **WYSIWYG Principle:** Always verify that visual state = actual state

**Test to Add:**
```javascript
describe('Trim Integration', () => {
  it('should play only trimmed portion', () => {
    // Import 30s video
    // Trim to 10s-20s
    // Play video
    // Expect: starts at 10s, stops at 20s
  });

  it('should export only trimmed portion', () => {
    // Import 30s video
    // Trim to 10s-20s
    // Export video
    // Expect: exported file is 10s long
  });
});
```

**Documentation Added:**
- `TRIM_AWARE_SYSTEM.md` - Comprehensive 600-line guide

---

## Impact Assessment

**Time Cost:**
- Finding bugs: 6.5 hours (including the 4-hour magnetic snap debugging marathon)
- Fixing bugs: 3.5 hours (including 2-hour trim integration)
- Testing fixes: 0 hours (manual testing)
- **Total:** 10 hours

**Could Have Been Prevented By:**
- ✅ Better planning (context usage documentation)
- ✅ More thorough testing (state management tests)
- ✅ Code review (duplicate reducer detection)
- ✅ Linting rules (exhaustive-deps, duplicate-keys)
- ✅ TypeScript (function signature validation)
- ✅ **Unit testing for conversion functions** (pixel-to-time validation)
- ✅ **Detailed logging during development** (would have caught unit mismatch immediately)

## Bug #9: Scrubber Positioned Incorrectly After Left Trim

**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Time to Debug:** 1 hour  
**Time to Fix:** 30 minutes  
**Impact:** Scrubber appeared in empty space instead of timeline start, breaking professional video editor UX

### The Issue

**What Went Wrong:**
After trimming a clip from the left handle, the scrubber (red playhead line) would appear in empty space to the right of the video clip instead of at the beginning of the timeline (0s mark).

**User Impact:**
- Scrubber positioned incorrectly in empty timeline space
- Professional video editor workflow broken
- User confusion about current playback position
- Inconsistent with industry standards (CapCut, iMovie)

### Root Cause Analysis

**Surface Issue:**
Scrubber appeared in wrong position after left trimming.

**Actual Cause:**
**COORDINATE SYSTEM MISMATCH** between timeline and video player:

1. **Timeline Playhead**: Expected relative time (0 = start of visible clip)
2. **Video Player**: Sent absolute timeline time (includes `trimIn` offset)
3. **App.js**: Directly set playhead to absolute time without conversion

**The Problem Sequence:**
1. Video loads → VideoPlayer seeks to `trimIn` (e.g., 3.6s)
2. Video plays → `onTimeUpdate` sends `timelineTime = trimIn + current` (3.6s)
3. App.js receives → `handleVideoTimeUpdate` gets `currentTime: 3.6`
4. Timeline updates → `setPlayhead(3.6)` sets playhead to 3.6s
5. Scrubber renders → `playheadPosition = timeToPixels(3.6) = 360px`
6. **Result**: Scrubber appears in empty space instead of timeline start

### The Fix

**Solution Implemented:**
Dual approach for maximum robustness:

1. **VideoPlayer Reset**: Always send `currentTime: 0` to timeline on video load
2. **App.js Conversion**: Convert timeline time back to relative time

**Technical Changes:**

**VideoPlayer.js:**
```javascript
// 🎯 CRITICAL FIX: Reset timeline playhead to 0 when video loads
// This prevents scrubber from appearing in empty space
// The video will play from trimIn, but timeline shows 0 as starting point
onTimeUpdate?.({
  currentTime: 0, // Always start timeline at 0, regardless of trimIn
  duration: video.duration
});
```

**App.js:**
```javascript
// 🎯 CRITICAL FIX: Convert timeline time back to relative timeline position
// VideoPlayer sends timeline time (includes trimIn offset), but timeline should show relative position
const selectedClip = getSelectedClip();
const trimIn = selectedClip?.trimIn || 0;
const relativeTime = Math.max(0, timelineTime - trimIn);

if (Math.abs(relativeTime - playhead) > 0.1) {
  setPlayhead(relativeTime);
}
```

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/VideoPlayer.js` (+5/-2 lines)
- `src/App.js` (+15/-5 lines)

**Commit:**
`fix(CRITICAL): correct scrubber positioning after left trim`

### Prevention Strategy

**How to Avoid This in Future:**
1. **Coordinate System Documentation**: Document which components use absolute vs relative time
2. **Unit Testing for Coordinate Conversion**: Test timeline-to-video and video-to-timeline conversions
3. **Visual Testing**: Always verify scrubber position after trimming operations
4. **Industry Standard Compliance**: Ensure behavior matches CapCut/iMovie standards

**Test to Add:**
```javascript
describe('Scrubber Positioning', () => {
  it('should position scrubber at timeline start after left trim', () => {
    // Import video
    // Trim from left handle
    // Verify scrubber is at 0s position
    // Verify video plays from trimmed position
  });
});
```

**Linting Rule:**
Consider adding ESLint rules to flag potential coordinate system mismatches in time-related functions.

- PR#11 Bug#1 - Missing IPC handler for different function
- PR#10 Bug#2 - Unit conversion error in different calculation function

**Pattern Recognition:**
1. **Context management and IPC setup** are common sources of bugs in Electron + React applications
2. **Unit conversion errors** (pixels vs time vs other units) are particularly dangerous because they can appear to work but produce wrong results
3. **Magnetic snap systems** require careful unit validation throughout the conversion chain
