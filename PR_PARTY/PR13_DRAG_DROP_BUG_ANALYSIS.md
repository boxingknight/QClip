## Bug #11: CRITICAL - `clip.type` Property Overwrites `action.type` in Dispatch

**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Time to Find:** 2 hours  
**Time to Fix:** 5 minutes  
**Impact:** Complete failure of drag-and-drop from Media Library to Timeline

### The Issue

**What Went Wrong:**
When dragging a clip from the Media Library to the Timeline, the `ADD_CLIP` reducer was never being called. Instead, the reducer received `action.type = "video"` instead of `action.type = "ADD_CLIP"`.

**Error Logs:**
```
🎬 [TRACK] DROP EVENT TRIGGERED!
🎬 [TRACK] ✅ Dropping MediaLibrary item: {name: '2videotirm.mp4'}
🎬 [TRACK] Calling addClip with: {trackId: 'video-1', clipId: '...', clipName: '2videotirm.mp4'}
🎬 [addClip] Dispatching ADD_CLIP: {...}
🎬 [addClip] Dispatch complete!
🎬 [REDUCER] Action received: video  // ❌ WRONG! Should be 'ADD_CLIP'
```

**User Impact:**
- Clips wouldn't appear on timeline after drag-and-drop
- Console showed successful drop but no visual update
- Timeline displayed "0 clips" despite successful drag operations

### Root Cause Analysis

**Surface Issue:**
The `ADD_CLIP` reducer case was never being executed.

**Actual Cause:**
In `src/context/TimelineContext.js`, the `addClip` function was spreading the clip object AFTER setting the action type:

```javascript
// ❌ WRONG ORDER
dispatch({ type: 'ADD_CLIP', trackId, ...clip });
```

The clip object has a `type: 'video'` property (for track type), which **OVERWRITES** the `type: 'ADD_CLIP'` action type!

So the action became:
```javascript
{
  type: 'video',  // ❌ THIS OVERWRITES 'ADD_CLIP'!
  trackId: 'video-1',
  id: 'clip-123',
  name: '1export.mp4',
  // ... rest of clip properties
}
```

**Why It Matters:**
- Redux/useReducer relies on `action.type` to route to the correct reducer case
- When `action.type = 'video'`, it falls through to the `default` case
- The reducer never processes the clip addition
- State remains unchanged, UI doesn't update

### The Fix

**Solution:**
Spread the clip object FIRST, then override with the action type:

```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT ORDER
dispatch({ ...clip, type: 'ADD_CLIP', trackId });
```

Now the final object is:
```javascript
{
  id: 'clip-123',
  name: '1export.mp4',
  type: 'ADD_CLIP',  // ✅ THIS IS THE FINAL VALUE
  trackId: 'video-1',
  // ... rest of clip properties
}
```

**Files Changed:**
- `src/context/TimelineContext.js` (+1/-1 lines)

**Commit:**
`fix(timeline): correct dispatch spread order to prevent type override`

### Prevention Strategy

**How to Avoid This in Future:**

1. **Always spread user data FIRST, then override with action type:**
   ```javascript
   // ✅ GOOD
   dispatch({ ...userData, type: 'ACTION_NAME', ...otherMetadata });
   
   // ❌ BAD
   dispatch({ type: 'ACTION_NAME', ...userData });  // userData can override type!
   ```

2. **Add type validation in dispatch wrapper:**
   ```javascript
   const addClip = (trackId, clip) => {
     console.log('🎬 [addClip] Dispatching ADD_CLIP:', {
       trackId,
       clipType: clip.type,  // ✅ Log the conflicting property
       fullClip: clip
     });
     
     dispatch({ ...clip, type: 'ADD_CLIP', trackId });
     
     console.log('🎬 [addClip] Dispatch complete!');
   };
   ```

3. **Rename conflicting properties:**
   ```javascript
   // Instead of clip.type, use clip.trackType or clip.mediaType
   const clip = {
     id: 'clip-123',
     trackType: 'video',  // ✅ No conflict!
     // ...
   };
   ```

4. **Add reducer validation:**
   ```javascript
   const timelineReducer = (state, action) => {
     console.log('🎬 [REDUCER] Action received:', action.type, action);
     
     // Validate action type
     if (action.type === 'video' || action.type === 'audio') {
       console.error('❌ [REDUCER] Received clip type instead of action type!');
       return state;
     }
     
     switch (action.type) {
       // ...
     }
   };
   ```

**Linting Rule:**
Consider adding ESLint rule to catch property conflicts:
```javascript
// .eslintrc.js
rules: {
  'no-duplicate-keys': 'error',  // Catches duplicate keys at compile time
}
```

## Bug #12: Clips Auto-Loading Into Timeline Instead of Media Library Only

**Severity:** 🟡 HIGH  
**Time to Find:** 30 minutes  
**Time to Fix:** 1 hour  
**Impact:** User workflow disruption - clips appeared on timeline immediately upon import

### The Issue

**What Went Wrong:**
When importing videos via the ImportPanel, clips would automatically appear on the timeline instead of only in the Media Library. The user wanted CapCut/iMovie behavior where clips are imported to a media library first, then explicitly dragged to the timeline.

**User Impact:**
- Clips appeared on timeline without user consent
- Couldn't reorder clips in Media Library before adding to timeline
- Removing a clip from timeline also removed it from Media Library
- Shared state between Media Library and Timeline (tight coupling)

### Root Cause Analysis

**Surface Issue:**
`ImportPanel` was calling `addClips()` which added clips directly to `TimelineContext`.

**Actual Cause:**
- `MediaLibrary` and `Timeline` were both reading from `TimelineContext`
- No separation between "project media" and "timeline clips"
- `ImportPanel` added clips to the Timeline state, not a separate Media Library state

**Why It Matters:**
- Professional video editors (CapCut, iMovie, Premiere Pro) all have separate media libraries
- Users need to organize/preview clips before adding to timeline
- Tight coupling makes future features (folders, favorites, search) impossible

### The Fix

**Solution: Separate Media Library State**

Created `src/context/MediaLibraryContext.js`:

```javascript
const MediaLibraryContext = createContext();

const mediaLibraryReducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_MEDIA_ITEMS':
      // Add to Media Library, NOT Timeline
      const newMediaItems = action.payload.filter(
        (newItem) => !state.mediaItems.some((existingItem) => existingItem.id === newItem.id)
      );
      return {
        ...state,
        mediaItems: [...state.mediaItems, ...newMediaItems],
        selectedMediaId: state.selectedMediaId || (newMediaItems.length > 0 ? newMediaItems[0].id : null),
      };
    case 'REMOVE_MEDIA_ITEM':
      return {
        ...state,
        mediaItems: state.mediaItems.filter((item) => item.id !== action.payload.id),
        selectedMediaId: state.selectedMediaId === action.payload.id ? null : state.selectedMediaId,
      };
    case 'REORDER_MEDIA':
      // Drag-and-drop reordering within Media Library
      const { startIndex, endIndex } = action.payload;
      const reorderedItems = Array.from(state.mediaItems);
      const [removed] = reorderedItems.splice(startIndex, 1);
      reorderedItems.splice(endIndex, 0, removed);
      return {
        ...state,
        mediaItems: reorderedItems,
      };
    // ... other cases
  }
};
```

**Updated `ImportPanel.js`:**
```javascript
const handleImport = (newClips) => {
  // ✅ Add to Media Library ONLY
  addMediaItems(newClips);
  
  // ✅ Select first clip for preview (NOT for timeline)
  if (newClips.length > 0) {
    selectMedia(newClips[0].id);
  }
  
  // ❌ REMOVED: addClips(newClips) - No longer add to timeline automatically
};
```

**Updated `MediaLibrary.js`:**
```javascript
const MediaLibrary = () => {
  const {
    mediaItems,  // ✅ From MediaLibraryContext
    selectedMediaId,
    selectMedia,
    reorderMedia,
    setDraggedMedia,
    clearDraggedMedia
  } = useMediaLibrary();
  
  // ... rest of component
};
```

**Updated `App.js` VideoPlayer logic:**
```javascript
{(() => {
  // Use MediaLibrary for preview, Timeline for editing
  const selectedMedia = getSelectedMedia();
  const selectedClip = getSelectedClip();
  
  // Priority: Timeline clip (if editing) > MediaLibrary (if previewing)
  const activeClip = selectedClip || selectedMedia;
  const videoSrc = activeClip?.path ? `file://${activeClip.path}` : null;
  
  return (
    <VideoPlayer 
      videoSrc={videoSrc}
      onTimeUpdate={handleVideoTimeUpdate}
      selectedClip={activeClip}
    />
  );
})()}
```

**Files Changed:**
- `src/context/MediaLibraryContext.js` (NEW, 150 lines) - Separate media library state
- `src/components/MediaLibrary.js` (+50/-30 lines) - Use MediaLibraryContext
- `src/App.js` (+20/-10 lines) - Integrate MediaLibraryProvider, update VideoPlayer logic
- `src/components/ImportPanel.js` (+5/-5 lines) - Add to Media Library instead of Timeline

**Commit:**
`feat(media-library): separate Media Library from Timeline state`

### Prevention Strategy

**How to Avoid This in Future:**

1. **Separation of Concerns:**
   - Always separate "project assets" from "timeline items"
   - Media Library = all imported media
   - Timeline = specific clips arranged in sequence

2. **State Management Architecture:**
   ```
   MediaLibraryContext:
   - mediaItems (all imported videos)
   - selectedMediaId (for preview)
   
   TimelineContext:
   - clips (clips on timeline)
   - selectedClipId (for editing)
   ```

3. **Clear Data Flow:**
   ```
   ImportPanel → MediaLibraryContext (add media items)
   MediaLibrary → TimelineContext (drag to timeline)
   Timeline → VideoPlayer (editing)
   MediaLibrary → VideoPlayer (preview)
   ```

4. **User Workflow:**
   - Import → Media Library
   - Preview → Click in Media Library
   - Add to Timeline → Drag from Media Library to Timeline
   - Edit → Click in Timeline

## Bug #13: Gaps Between Clips When Adding to Timeline

**Severity:** 🟡 MEDIUM  
**Time to Find:** 10 minutes  
**Time to Fix:** 30 minutes  
**Impact:** Unprofessional timeline appearance with gaps between clips

### The Issue

**What Went Wrong:**
When dragging multiple clips to the timeline, they would have gaps between them based on where the user dropped them. Professional video editors (CapCut, iMovie) automatically snap clips to the end of the previous clip.

**User Impact:**
- Clips appeared with gaps between them
- Required manual adjustment to align clips
- Unprofessional timeline appearance
- Export would include black frames in gaps

### Root Cause Analysis

**Surface Issue:**
Clips were positioned at the `dropTime` calculated from mouse position.

**Actual Cause:**
The `ADD_CLIP` reducer in `TimelineContext.js` was using `action.startTime || 0`:

```javascript
// ❌ WRONG: Uses drop position
const newClip = {
  startTime: action.startTime || 0,  // From mouse position!
  // ...
};
```

**Why It Matters:**
- Professional video editors automatically position clips sequentially
- Users expect "magnetic" timeline behavior
- Gaps in timeline require manual cleanup

### The Fix

**Solution: Automatic Snap-to-End Positioning**

Updated `ADD_CLIP` reducer to calculate next available position:

```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT: Calculate position based on existing clips
case 'ADD_CLIP':
  // Find all clips on the same track
  const clipsOnTrack = state.clips.filter(c => c.trackId === action.trackId);
  
  // Calculate next available start time (snap to end of last clip)
  let calculatedStartTime = 0;
  if (clipsOnTrack.length > 0) {
    // Find the clip with the latest end time
    const lastClipEnd = Math.max(...clipsOnTrack.map(c => {
      const clipDuration = c.trimOut - c.trimIn;
      return c.startTime + clipDuration;
    }));
    calculatedStartTime = lastClipEnd;  // ✅ Start at end of last clip
  }
  
  const newClip = {
    id: action.id || `clip-${Date.now()}`,
    trackId: action.trackId,
    name: action.name,
    path: action.path,
    startTime: calculatedStartTime,  // ✅ Use calculated position
    duration: action.duration,
    originalDuration: action.duration,
    trimIn: 0,
    trimOut: action.duration,
    // ... rest of properties
  };
  
  console.log('🎬 [ADD_CLIP REDUCER] Positioned clip at:', calculatedStartTime);
  
  return {
    ...state,
    clips: [...state.clips, newClip],
    selection: {
      ...state.selection,
      clips: [newClip.id]  // Auto-select new clip
    }
  };
```

**Before (Wrong):**
```
Timeline:
[Clip 1: 0-10s]    [gap]    [Clip 2: 15-25s]    [gap]
```

**After (Correct):**
```
Timeline:
[Clip 1: 0-10s][Clip 2: 10-20s][Clip 3: 20-30s]
```

**Files Changed:**
- `src/context/TimelineContext.js` (+15/-2 lines) - Snap-to-end logic in ADD_CLIP reducer

**Commit:**
`feat(timeline): implement automatic snap-to-end positioning for new clips`

### Prevention Strategy

**How to Avoid This in Future:**

1. **Always calculate clip positions based on timeline state, not user input:**
   ```javascript
   // ✅ GOOD: Calculate from timeline state
   const lastClipEnd = Math.max(...existingClips.map(c => c.endTime));
   const newClipStart = lastClipEnd;
   
   // ❌ BAD: Use user mouse position directly
   const newClipStart = dropX / zoom;
   ```

2. **Provide manual override for advanced users:**
   ```javascript
   // Add Shift+Drag to override snap-to-end
   const handleDrop = (e) => {
     if (e.shiftKey) {
       // Use manual positioning
     } else {
       // Use automatic snap-to-end
     }
   };
   ```

3. **Consistent magnetic behavior:**
   - Snap to end of last clip (primary)
   - Snap to clip edges when dragging (secondary)
   - Snap to time markers (tertiary)

4. **Visual feedback:**
   ```javascript
   // Show snap line when clip will snap
   {isSnapping && (
     <div className="snap-indicator" style={{ left: snapPosition }} />
   )}
   ```

## Continuous Playback (IN PROGRESS)

**Status:** ⏳ IN PROGRESS  
**Complexity:** HIGH  
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

### The Goal

Enable playback to continue automatically from one clip to the next on the timeline, similar to CapCut/iMovie.

### Current Behavior

- ✅ Playback works within a single clip
- ❌ Playback stops when clip ends
- ❌ User must manually advance to next clip

### Desired Behavior

- ✅ Playback continues through all clips sequentially
- ✅ Scrubber moves smoothly across clip boundaries
- ✅ Video switches automatically when playhead crosses clip boundary
- ✅ Audio remains synchronized

### Implementation Approach

**Step 1: Timeline Playback Manager (✅ IMPLEMENTED)**
```javascript
// App.js
{(() => {
  // Calculate which clip the playhead is currently over
  const currentTimelineClip = clips
    .filter(clip => clip.trackId === 'video-1')
    .sort((a, b) => a.startTime - b.startTime)
    .find(clip => {
      const clipEnd = clip.startTime + clip.duration;
      return playhead >= clip.startTime && playhead < clipEnd;
    });
  
  // Priority: Timeline clip at playhead > Selected clip > Media Library
  const activeClip = currentTimelineClip || selectedClip || selectedMedia;
  
  return (
    <VideoPlayer 
      videoSrc={activeClip?.path}
      selectedClip={activeClip}
      allClips={clips}
      onClipEnd={(nextClipStartTime) => {
        setPlayhead(nextClipStartTime);
      }}
    />
  );
})()}
```

**Step 2: Smart `onEnded` Handler (✅ IMPLEMENTED)**
```javascript
// VideoPlayer.js
onEnded={() => {
  // Check if there's a next clip
  if (selectedClip && allClips.length > 0 && onClipEnd) {
    const trackClips = allClips
      .filter(clip => clip.trackId === selectedClip.trackId)
      .sort((a, b) => a.startTime - b.startTime);
    
    const currentIndex = trackClips.findIndex(clip => clip.id === selectedClip.id);
    
    if (currentIndex !== -1 && currentIndex < trackClips.length - 1) {
      const nextClip = trackClips[currentIndex + 1];
      // Advance playhead to next clip
      onClipEnd(nextClip.startTime);
      return;  // Don't stop playing!
    }
  }
  
  // No next clip - stop playback
  setIsPlaying(false);
}}
```

**Step 3: Auto-Play on Clip Switch (✅ IMPLEMENTED)**
```javascript
// VideoPlayer.js - handleLoadedMetadata
const handleLoadedMetadata = () => {
  // ... metadata loading ...
  
  // Auto-play if playback was active (for continuous playback)
  if (playbackIsPlaying) {
    video.play();
  }
};
```

### Current Issue

**Problem:** Continuous playback not working yet

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Timing issue:** Video might not be loading fast enough before playback state changes
2. **Coordinate mismatch:** Timeline time vs video time conversion
3. **Playhead update race condition:** `setPlayhead` might be triggering re-render before video loads
4. **PlaybackContext state desync:** `playbackIsPlaying` might be false when clip switches

**Next Steps:**
1. Add comprehensive logging to trace playback state through clip transitions
2. Test with shorter videos to reduce loading time
3. Implement preloading for next clip
4. Add visual indicator showing next clip to play

## Lessons Learned

### Lesson 1: Object Spread Order Matters in Redux/useReducer

**What We Learned:**
In JavaScript, when using object spread syntax, the **last value wins**. If you're building Redux actions with spread syntax, always put the action type LAST to prevent user data from overwriting it.

**How to Apply:**
```javascript
// ✅ ALWAYS DO THIS
dispatch({ ...userData, type: 'ACTION_NAME', ...metadata });

// ❌ NEVER DO THIS
dispatch({ type: 'ACTION_NAME', ...userData });
```

**Future Impact:**
This pattern applies to ALL reducer actions. Added to coding standards for the project.

### Lesson 2: Separation of Concerns is Critical for Complex UIs

**What We Learned:**
Even though `MediaLibrary` and `Timeline` both display video clips, they serve different purposes and should have separate state management. Trying to share state led to tight coupling and limiting behavior.

**How to Apply:**
- Media Library = Project Assets (all imported media)
- Timeline = Arranged Sequence (specific clips in order)
- Separate contexts for each concept
- Clear data flow from one to the other

**Future Impact:**
This pattern enables:
- Media Library folders and organization
- Timeline layers and tracks
- Favorites and collections
- Search and filtering
- Non-destructive editing

### Lesson 3: Automatic Positioning Improves UX

**What We Learned:**
Professional video editors automatically position clips to create clean, gap-free timelines. Users expect this "magnetic" behavior and shouldn't have to manually adjust clip positions.

**How to Apply:**
- Calculate clip positions based on timeline state
- Provide visual feedback during drag
- Allow manual override with modifier keys (Shift)
- Implement snap-to points (clip edges, markers, etc.)

**Future Impact:**
Magnetic timeline is the foundation for:
- Ripple editing (deleting fills gap)
- Insert editing (push clips forward)
- Multi-track editing (snap to other tracks)
- Advanced alignment features
