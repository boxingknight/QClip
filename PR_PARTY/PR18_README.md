# PR#18: Webcam Recording - Quick Start

---

## TL;DR (30 seconds)

**What:** Webcam recording functionality that captures video from user's camera with audio, provides real-time preview, and saves recordings directly to Media Library.

**Why:** Essential for content creators, educators, and professionals who need to record themselves for tutorials, presentations, or content creation.

**Time:** 6 hours estimated

**Complexity:** HIGH

**Status:** üìã PLANNED

## Decision Framework (2 minutes)

### Should You Build This?

**Green Lights (Build it!):**
- ‚úÖ You have 6+ hours available for implementation
- ‚úÖ PR#17 (Screen Recording Setup) is complete
- ‚úÖ You want comprehensive recording capabilities
- ‚úÖ You're comfortable with WebRTC APIs
- ‚úÖ You understand this builds on existing recording infrastructure

**Red Lights (Skip/defer it!):**
- ‚ùå Time-constrained (<6 hours available)
- ‚ùå PR#17 not complete (missing foundation)
- ‚ùå Not interested in webcam recording features
- ‚ùå Prefer to focus on other V2 features first
- ‚ùå WebRTC APIs seem too complex

**Decision Aid:** This is a high-value feature that completes the recording suite alongside screen recording. Only proceed if you're committed to the full implementation and have the necessary time.

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: getUserMedia Permission Denied
**Symptoms:** Error message "Camera permission denied"  
**Cause:** Browser security requires HTTPS or localhost for camera access  
**Solution:** 
```bash
# Make sure you're running on HTTPS or localhost
npm start
# Should open https://localhost:3000 or similar
```

### Issue 2: No Cameras Found
**Symptoms:** "No cameras found" message  
**Cause:** No webcam devices available or permission not granted  
**Solution:**
- Check if webcam is connected
- Grant camera permission in browser
- Try refreshing the page

### Issue 3: Preview Not Showing
**Symptoms:** Black preview window  
**Cause:** Video stream not properly attached to video element  
**Solution:**
```javascript
// Make sure video element has proper attributes
<video
  ref={videoRef}
  autoPlay
  muted
  playsInline
  srcObject={stream}
/>
```

### Issue 4: Recording Not Starting
**Symptoms:** MediaRecorder fails to start  
**Cause:** Unsupported codec or invalid stream  
**Solution:**
```javascript
// Check for supported MIME types
const supportedTypes = [
  'video/webm;codecs=vp9,opus',
  'video/webm;codecs=vp8,opus',
  'video/webm'
];

const mimeType = supportedTypes.find(type => 
  MediaRecorder.isTypeSupported(type)
);
```

### Issue 5: Audio Not Recording
**Symptoms:** Video records but no audio  
**Cause:** Audio track not included in MediaStream  
**Solution:**
```javascript
// Make sure to request audio in getUserMedia
const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
  video: { deviceId },
  audio: true // This is required for audio
});
```

- `src/utils/webcamUtils.js` - Device enumeration utilities
- `src/context/RecordingContext.js` - Webcam recording state management
- `src/components/recording/WebcamPreview.js` - Preview component
- `src/components/recording/WebcamRecordingControls.js` - Main controls
- `src/hooks/useWebcamRecording.js` - Recording logic hook

### Key Functions
- `getWebcamDevices()` - Get list of available cameras
- `startWebcamRecording(deviceId, settings)` - Start recording
- `stopWebcamRecording()` - Stop and save recording
- `getWebcamPreview(deviceId)` - Get preview stream

### Key Concepts
- **MediaDevices API:** Browser API for accessing camera/microphone
- **MediaRecorder API:** Browser API for recording media streams
- **WebRTC:** Real-time communication APIs for web
- **getUserMedia:** Method to access user's media devices

### Useful Commands
```bash
# Start development
npm start

# Build for production
npm run build

# Test webcam access
# Open browser console and run:
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({video: true})
  .then(stream => console.log('Camera access granted'))
  .catch(err => console.log('Camera access denied:', err))
```

## Technical Notes

### Browser Compatibility
- **Chrome/Edge:** Full support
- **Firefox:** Full support
- **Safari:** Limited support (may need fallbacks)

### Security Requirements
- **HTTPS required** for production
- **Localhost allowed** for development
- **User permission required** for camera access

### Performance Considerations
- **Preview stream:** Lower quality for performance
- **Recording stream:** Higher quality for output
- **Memory management:** Clean up streams properly
- **File size:** WebM format is efficient
