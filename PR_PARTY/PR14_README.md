# PR#14: Drag & Drop Clips - Quick Start ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE & DEPLOYED  
**Implementation Date:** October 28, 2024  
**Time Taken:** 4-6 hours (as estimated)

---

## TL;DR (30 seconds)

**What:** Professional drag-and-drop functionality for clips on the multi-track timeline, enabling users to reorder clips within tracks, move clips between tracks, and organize clips with intelligent snapping (origin + clip edges).

**Why:** Drag-and-drop is the fundamental interaction pattern for professional video editors. Users expect to be able to rearrange clips intuitively, and this functionality is essential for professional workflow and user experience.

**Time:** 4-6 hours (completed as estimated)

**Complexity:** HIGH

**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE

## Decision Framework (2 minutes)

### Should You Build This?

**Green Lights (Build it!):**
- ‚úÖ PR #11 (State Management Refactor) complete
- ‚úÖ PR #12 (UI Component Library) complete
- ‚úÖ PR #13 (Professional Timeline) complete
- ‚úÖ Have 4-6 hours available
- ‚úÖ Excited about professional video editor features

**Red Lights (Skip/defer it!):**
- ‚ùå Prerequisites not complete
- ‚ùå Time-constrained (<4 hours)
- ‚ùå Other priorities (bug fixes, critical features)
- ‚ùå Not interested in drag-and-drop functionality

**Decision Aid:** This is a core professional video editor feature. If you want ClipForge to feel like a real video editor, this is essential. If you're focused on basic functionality, consider deferring.

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Drag not starting
**Symptoms:** Clicking and dragging clip doesn't start drag operation  
**Cause:** Missing draggable attribute or drag start handler  
**Solution:** 
```javascript
// Ensure Clip component has:
<div draggable={true} onDragStart={handleDragStart}>
```

### Issue 2: Drop not working
**Symptoms:** Dragging over track doesn't show drop feedback  
**Cause:** Missing preventDefault() or drop handlers  
**Solution:**
```javascript
// Ensure Track component has:
<div onDragOver={(e) => { e.preventDefault(); }} onDrop={handleDrop}>
```

### Issue 3: Snap not working
**Symptoms:** Clips don't snap to other clips  
**Cause:** Snap calculation not implemented or threshold too small  
**Solution:**
```javascript
// Check snap threshold (should be 0.5 seconds)
const snapThreshold = 0.5;
const snapTargets = calculateSnapTargets(clip, allClips, snapThreshold);
```

### Issue 4: Visual feedback missing
**Symptoms:** No visual indication during drag  
**Cause:** CSS classes not applied or missing styles  
**Solution:**
```javascript
// Ensure drag state classes are applied
const className = classNames('clip', {
  'dragging': dragState.isDragging && dragState.draggedClip?.id === clip.id
});
```

## Quick Reference

### Key Files
- `src/context/TimelineContext.js` - Drag state management
- `src/hooks/useDragDrop.js` - Drag and drop handlers
- `src/components/timeline/Clip.js` - Draggable clip component
- `src/components/timeline/Track.js` - Drop zone track component
- `src/utils/dragDropCalculations.js` - Snap and validation utilities

### Key Functions
- `startDrag(clipId, trackId, startTime)` - Start drag operation
- `updateDrag(trackId, time)` - Update drag position
- `completeDrag()` - Complete drag operation
- `calculateSnapTargets(clip, allClips)` - Find snap targets
- `isValidDropPosition(trackId, time, clip)` - Validate drop

### Key Concepts
- **HTML5 Drag & Drop API:** Native browser drag and drop support
- **Snap-to-Clip:** Automatic alignment with other clips (0.5s threshold)
- **Overlap Prevention:** Prevents clips from overlapping
- **Context Integration:** Drag state managed through TimelineContext

### Useful Commands
```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Build and test
npm run build && npm start

# Check for linting errors
npm run lint
```

## Success Metrics

**You'll know it's working when:**
- [ ] Can drag clips between tracks
- [ ] Can drag clips within the same track
- [ ] Snap-to-clip works with visual feedback
- [ ] Overlaps are prevented
- [ ] Drag preview shows clip information
- [ ] Drop zones highlight during drag

**Performance Targets:**

## Motivation

**You've got this!** üí™

ClipForge already has a professional timeline with multi-track support. Adding drag-and-drop functionality will transform it from a static editor into an interactive, professional video editing experience. This is the feature that makes users say "Wow, this feels like a real video editor!"

The HTML5 Drag & Drop API provides excellent accessibility support, and the snap-to-clip functionality will make precise editing effortless. Once this is complete, ClipForge will rival professional video editing software in terms of user experience.
