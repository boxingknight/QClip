## What We're Building

### PR#01: Project Setup & Boilerplate
**Build Time:** 4 hours  
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Foundation PR  
**Complexity:** LOW

**Deliverables:**
1. Git repository initialized
2. npm project with all dependencies
3. Webpack bundling configured
4. Electron main process running
5. Preload script for IPC communication
6. React application rendering
7. "Welcome to ClipForge" UI displaying
8. IPC communication verified working

**Key Features:**
- Working Electron + React setup
- Development environment configured
- Build pipeline operational
- Foundation for all future PRs

---

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Electron + React Stack
**Choice:** Electron + React + Webpack  
**Rationale:**
- Mature ecosystem with extensive documentation
- Large community and abundant examples
- Faster development for 72-hour constraint
- Better FFmpeg integration options
- Easier learning curve than Tauri

**Impact:** Allows rapid development, proven stack

### Decision 2: Project Structure
**Choice:** Single repo with folder structure (not monorepo)  
**Rationale:**
- Simpler for MVP timeline
- Faster to navigate
- Standard Electron structure
- Fewer build config files

**Impact:** Cleaner organization, easier to understand

### Decision 3: IPC Architecture
**Choice:** Secure IPC with contextBridge and preload  
**Rationale:**
- Best practices (context isolation enabled)
- Security best practices
- Clear separation of main/renderer
- Establishes pattern for future PRs

**Impact:** Secure, maintainable IPC communication

### Decision 4: Development Workflow
**Choice:** Two-terminal development (webpack dev + electron)  
**Rationale:**
- Hot reload for React
- Immediate feedback
- Clear separation of concerns
- Standard Electron dev pattern

**Impact:** Fast development iteration

## Implementation Strategy

### Timeline
```
Hour 1: Git + npm initialization (30 min)
        Install dependencies (20 min)
        Webpack config (20 min)

Hour 2: Electron main process (30 min)
        Preload script (20 min)
        Create directory structure (10 min)

Hour 3: React app creation
        HTML template (10 min)
        Entry point (15 min)
        App component (15 min)
        Styles (10 min)
        Testing setup (20 min)

Hour 4: Final testing (20 min)
        README documentation (30 min)
        Commit and verify (10 min)
```

### Approach

**Phase 1:** Infrastructure (Git, npm, dependencies)  
**Phase 2:** Electron setup (main process, preload)  
**Phase 3:** React app creation  
**Phase 4:** Testing and documentation

**Key Principle:** Test after EACH phase, don't wait until end

---

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- [ ] 10 files created (as specified)
- [ ] All dependencies installed
- [ ] Zero console errors
- [ ] App launches in <5 seconds

### Qualitative
- [ ] Project feels ready for development
- [ ] Structure is clear and logical
- [ ] Team (or AI) can continue easily
- [ ] Setup process is documented clearly

---

## Risks Identified & Mitigated

### Risk 1: Setup Time Overrun 🟡 MEDIUM
**Issue:** Could take longer than 4 hours if issues arise  
**Mitigation:** 
- Use proven boilerplate patterns
- Test after each phase
- Have fallback config ready
**Status:** Documentation provides clear path

### Risk 2: Webpack + Electron Integration 🟢 LOW
**Issue:** Configuration could be complex  
**Mitigation:**
- Follow standard Electron + React examples
- Test webpack build immediately
- Verify dev server works before moving on
**Status:** Simple config, well-tested pattern

### Risk 3: IPC Communication 🟢 LOW
**Issue:** IPC might not work on first try  
**Mitigation:**
- Include test function (`ping()`) in this PR
- Verify in this PR, not later
- Follow context isolation best practices
**Status:** Included test in PR scope

**Overall Risk:** 🟢 LOW

---

## Hot Tips

### Tip 1: Test Early and Often
**Why:** Catch issues immediately, not after hours of work

**How:**
- Run `npm run dev` after webpack config
- Launch Electron after main process created
- Verify IPC after preload script
- Don't wait until "everything is done" to test

### Tip 2: Commit After Each Phase
**Why:** Clean git history, easy to rollback if issues

**Commit Strategy:**
```bash
# After phase 1
git commit -m "chore: initialize project"

# After phase 2
git commit -m "chore: install dependencies"

# After phase 3
git commit -m "feat: add Electron main process"

# etc...
```

### Tip 3: Read the Full Spec Before Starting
**Why:** Understand the big picture, avoid rework

**Time investment:** 15-30 minutes reading saves 1+ hours of debugging

## Go / No-Go Decision

### ✅ Go If:
- You have 4 hours available
- Node.js 18+ installed
- Understanding of npm basics
- Can follow detailed checklist
- Willing to test as you go

### ❌ No-Go If:
- Less than 3 hours available
- No Node.js installed
- Don't understand npm/JavaScript basics
- Want to skip this and go to "fun" features (impossible - this is required)

**Decision Aid:** This PR is **mandatory**. All other 9 PRs depend on it. If you want ClipForge to exist, you must complete this PR first.

**Recommendation:** ✅ **GO** - This is the foundation of the entire project.

---

## Immediate Next Actions

### Pre-Flight (5 minutes)
- [ ] Read implementation checklist (`PR01_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md`)
- [ ] Verify Node.js 18+ installed (`node --version`)
- [ ] Clear next 4 hours on calendar
- [ ] Open terminal in `/Users/loganmay/QClip`

### Day 1 Goals (4 hours)
- [ ] Complete Phase 1: Git & npm initialization
- [ ] Complete Phase 2: Install dependencies
- [ ] Complete Phase 3: Build configuration
- [ ] Complete Phase 4: Electron setup
- [ ] Complete Phase 5: React application
- [ ] Complete Phase 6: Testing & verification
- [ ] Complete Phase 7: Documentation

**Checkpoint:** App launches with "Welcome to ClipForge" and all green checkmarks

---

## Conclusion

**Planning Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Confidence Level:** 🟢 HIGH  
**Recommendation:** **BUILD IT** - This is a straightforward setup PR with clear steps and low risk.

**Next Step:** When ready, start with Phase 1 (Git & npm initialization)

---

**You've got this!** 💪

This is the foundation. Once this setup is complete, you'll have 68 hours left to build the actual video editor features. Every hour spent here is an investment in smooth development for the remaining 10 PRs.

*"The best setup is the one you can start coding in immediately."*
