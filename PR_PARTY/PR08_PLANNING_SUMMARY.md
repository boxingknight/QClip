## What We're Building

### [6] Major Improvements

| Feature | Time | Priority | Impact |
|---------|------|----------|--------|
| Error Boundary | 45 min | HIGH | Prevents app crashes |
| Logging Infrastructure | 30 min | HIGH | Enables debugging |
| Video Metadata Extraction | 60 min | MEDIUM | Better UX with clip info |
| Enhanced Error Handling | 60 min | HIGH | User-friendly error messages |
| Trim Validation | 30 min | HIGH | Prevents invalid exports |
| Memory Leak Fixes | 30 min | HIGH | Ensures stability |

**Total Time:** 4 hours

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Error Boundary Approach
**Choice:** React ErrorBoundary + Window error handlers  
**Rationale:** Comprehensive coverage for all error types  
**Impact:** App never crashes completely, always shows error UI

### Decision 2: Logging Strategy
**Choice:** Logger utility with debug mode toggle  
**Rationale:** Professional debugging without production noise  
**Impact:** Easy debugging in dev, clean console in production

### Decision 3: Metadata Extraction
**Choice:** Extract on import with graceful failure  
**Rationale:** Better UX without blocking imports  
**Impact:** Users see video info, can still import problematic files

### Decision 4: Trim Validation
**Choice:** Validate before allowing export  
**Rationale:** Prevents invalid exports and user frustration  
**Impact:** Better UX, fewer failed exports

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Timeline
```
Hour 1: Error Infrastructure (logger, ErrorBoundary, window handlers)
Hour 2: Video Metadata Extraction (utility, IPC, integration)
Hour 3: Enhanced Error Handling (import, player, export)
Hour 4: Trim Validation + Memory Management (validation, cleanup, logging)
```

### Key Principle
**Test error scenarios after each phase.** Don't just fix happy path bugs - intentionally break things to ensure errors are handled correctly.

### Phases Overview

#### Phase 1: Error Infrastructure (1 hour)
- Create logger utility
- Create ErrorBoundary component
- Add window error handlers
- Integrate with App
- **Success:** ErrorBoundary catches component errors, logs appear

#### Phase 2: Video Metadata Extraction (1 hour)
- Create metadata extraction utility
- Add IPC handler in main process
- Integrate in ImportPanel
- **Success:** Metadata extracted and stored with clips

#### Phase 3: Enhanced Error Handling (1 hour)
- Improve ImportPanel error handling
- Improve VideoPlayer error handling
- Improve ExportPanel error handling
- Add retry logic for export
- **Success:** All components show helpful error messages

#### Phase 4: Trim Validation (30 min)
- Create trim validation utility
- Integrate in TrimControls
- **Success:** Invalid trim points show errors

#### Phase 5: Memory Management (30 min)
- Add VideoPlayer cleanup
- Add logging throughout app
- **Success:** No memory leaks, memory stable

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- [ ] Zero app crashes (ErrorBoundary working)
- [ ] All error messages user-friendly (not technical jargon)
- [ ] Memory stable after 30 minutes use
- [ ] Metadata extracted in <5 seconds
- [ ] Trim validation catches all invalid inputs

### Qualitative
- [ ] App feels stable and reliable
- [ ] Errors help users understand what went wrong
- [ ] Debugging is easy with structured logs
- [ ] No unexpected behavior or crashes

## Risks Identified & Mitigated

### Risk 1: ErrorBoundary Breaks Existing Functionality üü° MEDIUM
**Issue:** Adding ErrorBoundary might interfere with existing components  
**Mitigation:** Test all features after adding ErrorBoundary  
**Status:** Documented, will test thoroughly

### Risk 2: Metadata Extraction Fails for Valid Videos üü¢ LOW
**Issue:** ffprobe might fail on valid video files  
**Mitigation:** Handle gracefully - import with warning, extract metadata async  
**Status:** Handled in design

### Risk 3: Memory Leaks Undetected üü° MEDIUM
**Issue:** Memory leaks might not be immediately obvious  
**Mitigation:** Use React DevTools profiler, test with many clip switches  
**Status:** Will monitor during testing

### Risk 4: Too Much Logging Slows App üü¢ LOW
**Issue:** Excessive logging might degrade performance  
**Mitigation:** Log only in debug mode, use conditional logging  
**Status:** Low risk, logging disabled in production

### Risk 5: Export Error Recovery Not Tested üü° MEDIUM
**Issue:** Retry logic might not work correctly  
**Mitigation:** Test with various failure scenarios  
**Status:** Will test thoroughly

**Overall Risk:** üü¢ LOW - Well-understood patterns, comprehensive testing planned

## Hot Tips

### Tip 1: Test Error Scenarios Intentionally
**Why:** Error handling code is only as good as the error scenarios you test. Don't just run happy path - break things on purpose to ensure errors are caught and displayed correctly.

### Tip 2: Use React DevTools Profiler
**Why:** Memory leaks aren't always obvious from casual testing. Use the profiler to identify leaks early and verify fixes work.

### Tip 3: Log Everything (In Debug Mode)
**Why:** When something goes wrong, comprehensive logs make debugging 10x easier. You can always disable logs in production, but you can't retroactively add logging.

### Tip 4: Don't Skip Memory Management
**Why:** Even if you don't see leaks immediately, they compound over time. One bad cleanup can cause issues after extended use.

### Tip 5: User-Friendly > Technical
**Why:** Error messages should help users, not confuse them. "Video file format not supported" is better than "Codec 'avc1' not found."

## Go / No-Go Decision

### Go If:
- ‚úÖ All previous PRs complete (PRs #1-6)
- ‚úÖ App runs and core features work
- ‚úÖ You have 4 hours available
- ‚úÖ Want production-ready, stable app

### No-Go If:
- ‚ùå Previous PRs incomplete
- ‚ùå App doesn't run yet
- ‚ùå Time-constrained (<3 hours)
- ‚ùå All features work perfectly with no errors (unlikely)

**Decision Aid:** If you've encountered ANY errors, crashes, or unexpected behavior during testing, you MUST do this PR. It transforms your app from a demo to a production application.

---

## Immediate Next Actions

### Pre-Flight (5 minutes)
- [ ] Prerequisites checked (PRs #1-6 complete)
- [ ] App runs successfully
- [ ] Branch created: `git checkout -b fix/error-handling`

### Hour 1 Goals (Error Infrastructure)
- [ ] Create logger utility
- [ ] Create ErrorBoundary component
- [ ] Add window error handlers
- [ ] Integrate with App

**Checkpoint:** Error infrastructure complete, ErrorBoundary catches errors

---

## Conclusion

**Planning Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Confidence Level:** üü¢ HIGH  
**Recommendation:** Build this now if previous PRs are complete. This is the finishing touch that makes your app production-ready.

**Next Step:** When ready, start with Phase 1: Error Infrastructure.

---

**You've got this!** üí™

You've built all the features. This PR makes them reliable, stable, and production-ready. Every error you handle, every memory leak you fix, every validation you add makes your app more professional.

---

**Key Insight:** Error handling isn't overhead - it's what separates a working demo from a production application. Users will encounter errors. You must handle them gracefully.

*"The best apps aren't the ones with the most features - they're the ones that handle errors the best."*
