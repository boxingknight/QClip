## Bug #1: Recording Stuck in Loading Loop

**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Time to Find:** 10 minutes  
**Time to Fix:** 30 minutes  
**Impact:** Users couldn't start recording - UI stuck in loading state

### The Issue

**What Went Wrong:**
Recording would get stuck in a loading loop when attempting to start. The UI would show "Starting recording..." but never complete.

**Error Message:**
```
Recording stuck in loading state
getUserMedia failed repeatedly
```

**User Impact:**
- Complete inability to record screen
- Broken core feature
- Poor user experience

### Root Cause Analysis

**Surface Issue:**
Recording stuck in loading loop

**Actual Cause:**
Incorrect `getUserMedia` constraints for Electron's `desktopCapturer` API. The constraints weren't properly formatted for Electron's specific requirements.

**Why It Matters:**
Electron's `desktopCapturer` requires specific constraint format different from standard web `getUserMedia`.

### The Fix

**Before (Broken):**
```javascript
const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
  audio: false,
  video: {
    mandatory: {
      chromeMediaSource: 'desktop',
      chromeMediaSourceId: sourceId
    }
  }
});
```

**After (Fixed):**
```javascript
const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
  audio: false,
  video: {
    mandatory: {
      chromeMediaSource: 'desktop',
      chromeMediaSourceId: sourceId
    }
  }
});
// Actually, the issue was missing error handling and timer cleanup
// Also needed to ensure constraints match Electron's desktopCapturer format
```

**Additional Fixes:**
- Added proper error handling in `startRecording`
- Added timer cleanup on failure
- Improved state reset on failure
- Added timeout handling

### Files Changed
- `src/context/RecordingContext.js` (+50/-20 lines)

### Commit
`fix(pr17): Fix recording stuck in loading loop with proper error handling`

### Prevention Strategy

**How to Avoid This in Future:**
1. Always test Electron-specific APIs early
2. Add comprehensive error handling for async operations
3. Use proper timeout mechanisms
4. Test on actual Electron environment, not just browser

## Bug #2: Source Picker Not Always Showing

**Severity:** 🟡 HIGH  
**Time to Find:** 5 minutes  
**Time to Fix:** 15 minutes  
**Impact:** Users couldn't select their screen source if they had multiple screens

### The Issue

**What Went Wrong:**
Source picker modal wouldn't always appear when starting a recording, preventing users from choosing which screen to record.

**User Impact:**
- Can't record specific screen when multiple screens available
- Confusion about which screen is being recorded
- Poor UX for multi-monitor setups

### Root Cause Analysis

**Surface Issue:**
Source picker not showing consistently

**Actual Cause:**
Conditional logic that only showed source picker if `recordingSource` was null, but it wasn't being cleared properly.

### The Fix

**Before (Broken):**
```javascript
const handleStartRecording = async () => {
  if (!recordingSource) {
    // Show source picker
  } else {
    // Start directly
  }
};
```

**After (Fixed):**
```javascript
const handleStartRecording = async () => {
  // Always show source picker to allow user to change source
  await getAvailableSources();
  showModal('source-picker', { /* ... */ });
};
```

### Files Changed
- `src/components/recording/RecordingControls.js` (+10/-5 lines)
- `src/App.js` (+20/-10 lines) - Added SourcePicker modal integration

### Commit
`fix(pr17): Always show source picker for screen selection`

### Prevention Strategy

**How to Avoid This in Future:**
1. Always allow users to change settings (don't hide UI)
2. Test with multiple screens/monitors
3. Provide clear visual feedback for selected source

## Bug #3: Recording File Corrupted (ArrayBuffer Serialization)

**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Time to Find:** 20 minutes  
**Time to Fix:** 45 minutes  
**Impact:** Recorded files were corrupted and unplayable

### The Issue

**What Went Wrong:**
Recording would save, but the file would be corrupted and couldn't be played back.

**Error Message:**
```
Failed to save recording: TypeError: blob.arrayBuffer is not a function
File saved but corrupted/unplayable
```

**User Impact:**
- Recordings saved but unusable
- Lost work/time
- Frustrating user experience

### Root Cause Analysis

**Surface Issue:**
Corrupted recording files

**Actual Cause:**
Blob objects cannot be serialized directly over Electron IPC. Need to convert to ArrayBuffer first.

**Why It Matters:**
Electron IPC can only transfer certain data types. Blobs need conversion before IPC transfer.

### The Fix

**Before (Broken):**
```javascript
// RecordingContext.js - Sending Blob directly
const blob = new Blob(recordedChunks, { type: 'video/webm' });
await window.electronAPI.saveRecordingFile(blob, filePath);

// main.js - Trying to use Blob directly
ipcMain.handle('save-recording-file', async (event, blob, filePath) => {
  // blob cannot be serialized
});
```

**After (Fixed):**
```javascript
// RecordingContext.js - Convert to ArrayBuffer
const blob = new Blob(recordedChunks, { type: 'video/webm' });
const arrayBuffer = await blob.arrayBuffer();
await window.electronAPI.saveRecordingFile(arrayBuffer, filePath);

// main.js - Accept ArrayBuffer and convert to Buffer
ipcMain.handle('save-recording-file', async (event, arrayBuffer, filePath) => {
  const buffer = Buffer.from(arrayBuffer);
  await fs.promises.writeFile(filePath, buffer);
});
```

### Files Changed
- `src/context/RecordingContext.js` (+5/-3 lines)
- `main.js` (+10/-5 lines)
- `preload.js` (+3/-3 lines)

### Commit
`fix(pr17): Fix recording file corruption with ArrayBuffer serialization`

### Prevention Strategy

**How to Avoid This in Future:**
1. Always convert Blobs to ArrayBuffer before IPC
2. Document IPC transfer requirements
3. Test file I/O early in development
4. Verify saved files are playable

## Bug #4: Recording Duration Zero (WebM Container Finalization)

**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Time to Find:** 30 minutes  
**Time to Fix:** 2 hours  
**Impact:** Recorded files showed 0 seconds duration, were corrupted

### The Issue

**What Went Wrong:**
Recorded files had `duration: 0` and were corrupted/unplayable despite having correct file size.

**Error Message:**
```
Duration: 0 seconds
File size: 2.1 MB (non-zero)
File appears corrupted
```

**User Impact:**
- Recordings unusable
- Lost work
- Broken core feature

### Root Cause Analysis

**Surface Issue:**
Duration 0, corrupted files

**Actual Cause:**
Two issues:
1. **Format mismatch:** WebM data saved with `.mp4` extension = corrupted file
2. **MediaRecorder finalization timing:** Blob created before MediaRecorder finalized WebM container structure

**Why It Matters:**
WebM requires complete container structure for valid duration metadata. MediaRecorder's `onstop` fires before final chunks (metadata, container headers) arrive.

### The Fix

**Issue 1: Format Mismatch**
```javascript
// Always save as .webm since MediaRecorder outputs WebM
if (filePath.endsWith('.mp4')) {
  filePath = filePath.slice(0, -4) + '.webm';
  logger.warn('User selected .mp4 extension, converting to .webm');
}
```

**Issue 2: MediaRecorder Finalization**
```javascript
// Use closure-based chunks array instead of React state
const chunks = [];
mediaRecorder.ondataavailable = (e) => {
  if (e.data.size > 0) {
    chunks.push(e.data);
  }
};

// Wait for onstop event with Promise
const stopPromise = new Promise((resolve) => {
  mediaRecorder.onstop = () => {
    resolve();
  };
});

// Request data before and after stop
mediaRecorder.requestData();
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
mediaRecorder.stop();
await stopPromise;
mediaRecorder.requestData();
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 50));

// Now create blob with all chunks
const blob = new Blob(chunks, { type: 'video/webm' });
```

### Files Changed
- `src/context/RecordingContext.js` (+80/-40 lines)

### Commit
`fix(pr17): Fix recording duration zero with WebM finalization and format enforcement`

### Prevention Strategy

**How to Avoid This in Future:**
1. Match file extension to actual format (WebM → .webm)
2. Wait for MediaRecorder `onstop` event
3. Call `requestData()` before and after stop
4. Add small delays for container finalization
5. Test with actual playback to verify file integrity

## Bug #5: WebM Not Supported for Import

**Severity:** 🟡 HIGH  
**Time to Find:** 10 minutes  
**Time to Fix:** 15 minutes  
**Impact:** Users couldn't import their recorded WebM files into the editor

### The Issue

**What Went Wrong:**
Recordings saved as WebM, but WebM wasn't supported for import, breaking the workflow.

**User Impact:**
- Record → Import → Edit workflow broken
- Users couldn't edit their recordings
- Confusing error messages

### Root Cause Analysis

**Surface Issue:**
WebM import not supported

**Actual Cause:**
File validation only allowed MP4 and MOV formats. WebM wasn't added to valid extensions.

### The Fix

**Decision:** Support WebM import (better than conversion)

**Rationale:**
- Faster: No conversion delay
- Better quality: No re-encoding
- Simpler: Just add .webm to validation

**Files Modified:**
- `src/utils/fileHelpers.js` - Added `.webm` to `validExtensions`
- `src/components/ImportPanel.js` - Added `'webm'` to extension validation
- `main.js` - Added `'webm'` to file dialog filters

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// fileHelpers.js
const validExtensions = ['.mp4', '.mov', '.webm'];

// ImportPanel.js
if (ext !== 'mp4' && ext !== 'mov' && ext !== 'webm') {
  // Error
}

// main.js
filters: [
  { name: 'Video Files', extensions: ['mp4', 'mov', 'webm'] }
]
```

### Files Changed
- `src/utils/fileHelpers.js` (+1/-1 line)
- `src/components/ImportPanel.js` (+1/-1 line)
- `main.js` (+1/-1 line)

### Commit
`feat(pr17): Add WebM support for video import`

### Prevention Strategy

**How to Avoid This in Future:**
1. Check import format support matches export formats
2. Test complete workflows (record → import → edit)
3. Document all supported formats
4. Consider format conversion as alternative solution

**Documentation:** See `PR17_WEBM_MP4_COMPATIBILITY_ANALYSIS.md` for detailed analysis

## Bug #6: Playhead Not Respecting Trim Bounds

**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Time to Find:** 15 minutes  
**Time to Fix:** 1.5 hours  
**Impact:** After trimming, playhead continues past trim and plays full video instead of trimmed portion

### The Issue

**What Went Wrong:**
After trimming a video, the playhead would continue past the trimmed section and keep playing the full video, even though the export worked correctly with the trimmed length.

**User Impact:**
- Confusing playback behavior
- Users see more than intended
- Export correct but playback wrong (very confusing!)

### Root Cause Analysis

**Surface Issue:**
Playhead continues past trim

**Actual Cause:**
Multiple issues:
1. VideoPlayer used full `video.duration` instead of trimmed duration
2. `onTimeUpdate` didn't stop at `trimOut`
3. `PlaybackContext.seek()` didn't respect `trimOut` bounds
4. No clamping of video `currentTime` to trim bounds

### The Fix

**Fix 1: Use trimData prop instead of selectedClip.trimIn/Out**
```javascript
// Get trim data from prop (current trim) or clip (default)
const trimIn = trimData?.inPoint ?? selectedClip.trimIn ?? 0;
const trimOut = trimData?.outPoint ?? selectedClip.trimOut ?? video.duration;
```

**Fix 2: Calculate trimmed duration**
```javascript
const trimmedDuration = Math.max(0, trimOut - trimIn);
setDuration(trimmedDuration); // Not full video.duration!
```

**Fix 3: Stop playback at trimOut**
```javascript
if (current >= trimOut) {
  video.pause();
  video.currentTime = trimOut;
  setIsPlaying(false);
  return;
}
```

**Fix 4: Clamp video time during playback**
```javascript
// Prevent playing outside trimmed region
if (current < trimIn) video.currentTime = trimIn;
if (current > trimOut) video.currentTime = trimOut;
```

**Fix 5: Fix PlaybackContext seek()**
```javascript
// Clamp to trim bounds, not full video duration
const clampedVideoTime = Math.max(trimIn, Math.min(videoTime, trimOut));
```

**Fix 6: Respond to playhead changes**
```javascript
// useEffect that seeks video when playhead changes, respecting trim bounds
useEffect(() => {
  // Calculate video time, clamped to trim bounds
  // Seek only if significantly different (avoid loops)
}, [playhead, selectedClip, trimData]);
```

### Files Changed
- `src/components/VideoPlayer.js` (+152/-50 lines)
- `src/context/PlaybackContext.js` (+25/-10 lines)

### Commit
`fix(pr17): Fix playhead and player respecting trim bounds`

### Prevention Strategy

**How to Avoid This in Future:**
1. Always use `trimData` prop for current trim state (not stale `selectedClip.trimOut`)
2. Validate all duration calculations use trimmed duration
3. Test playback after trimming operations
4. Ensure seek operations respect trim bounds
5. Test export matches playback display

## Bug #7: WebM Duration Zero on Import (FFprobe Failure)

**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Time to Find:** 30 minutes  
**Time to Fix:** 2 hours  
**Impact:** WebM files showed 0:00 duration in MediaLibrary and Timeline

### The Issue

**What Went Wrong:**
Imported WebM files showed `0:00` duration in MediaLibrary and Timeline, even though the actual video was 4 seconds long.

**Error Message:**
```
Duration: 0:00 (should be 0:04)
Timeline shows 10s (hardcoded fallback)
```

**User Impact:**
- Incorrect duration display
- Confusion about video length
- Drag-and-drop issues (0 duration clips invalid)

### Root Cause Analysis

**Surface Issue:**
WebM files showing 0 duration

**Actual Cause:**
FFprobe fails to read duration from some WebM files (returns 0). The HTML5 video element fallback wasn't working because:
1. Video element was returning `Infinity` initially
2. No validation for Infinity/NaN values
3. Hardcoded 10-second fallback in Track.js when duration was 0

### The Fix

**Fix 1: HTML5 Video Element Fallback**
```javascript
// In extractVideoMetadata - if FFprobe returns 0, try HTML5 video element
if (!duration || duration === 0) {
  const videoDuration = await getDurationFromVideoElement(filePath);
  if (videoDuration > 0) {
    duration = videoDuration;
  }
}
```

**Fix 2: Handle Infinity Duration**
```javascript
// Video element can return Infinity for WebM - handle with seek-to-end trick
if (!isFinite(duration) || duration === Infinity) {
  // Try seeking to end to force duration calculation
  video.currentTime = 1e10;
  // Wait for durationchange event
  // Check after delays (100ms, 500ms)
}
```

**Fix 3: Duration Change Event Listener**
```javascript
// Listen for durationchange - fires when duration becomes available
video.addEventListener('durationchange', () => {
  const duration = video.duration;
  if (duration > 0 && isFinite(duration)) {
    resolve(duration);
  }
});
```

**Fix 4: Remove Hardcoded 10s Fallback**
```javascript
// Track.js - Changed from:
duration: sourceClip.duration || 10,  // ❌ Wrong!

// To:
duration: sourceClip.duration || 0,   // ✅ No hardcoded fallback
```

### Files Changed
- `src/utils/videoMetadata.js` (+150/-50 lines)
- `src/components/timeline/Track.js` (+1/-1 line)

### Commit
`fix(pr17): Add HTML5 video element fallback for WebM duration extraction`

### Prevention Strategy

**How to Avoid This in Future:**
1. Always have fallback for duration extraction
2. Handle Infinity/NaN from video element
3. Test with problematic file formats (WebM, especially)
4. Don't use hardcoded duration fallbacks
5. Validate duration before using in calculations

## Bug #8: Video Element Returning Infinity Duration

**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Time to Find:** 1 hour  
**Time to Fix:** 2 hours  
**Impact:** Display showed "Infinity:NaN", all duration calculations broken

### The Issue

**What Went Wrong:**
Video element was returning `Infinity` for duration, causing "Infinity:NaN" display and breaking all duration calculations.

**Error Message:**
```
Duration: Infinity:NaN (display)
trimOut: Infinity
trimmedDuration: Infinity
```

**User Impact:**
- Complete UI breakdown
- Unusable player
- Confusing error display

### Root Cause Analysis

**Surface Issue:**
Infinity:NaN display

**Actual Cause:**
Video element's `duration` property can be `Infinity` when metadata isn't fully loaded. Code wasn't validating:
- `video.duration || 0` still equals `Infinity` (truthy value!)
- `Infinity` values propagated through all calculations
- No `isFinite()` checks before using duration

**Why It Matters:**
`Infinity || 0 = Infinity`, not 0! Need explicit `isFinite()` validation.

### The Fix

**Fix: Validate ALL video.duration Reads**
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG:
const videoDuration = video.duration || 0;  // Infinity || 0 = Infinity!

// ✅ CORRECT:
let videoDuration = video.duration || 0;
if (!isFinite(videoDuration) || isNaN(videoDuration) || videoDuration <= 0) {
  videoDuration = selectedClip.originalDuration || selectedClip.duration || 0;
}
```

**Locations Fixed:**
1. `handleLoadedMetadata` - Before updating clip duration
2. Register video element - Before setting trimOut
3. Playhead seek effect - Before calculations
4. `handlePlayPause` - Before trim calculations
5. `onTimeUpdate` - Before trim calculations
6. `onEnded` - Before calculating trimmedDuration
7. No clip selected case - Before setting duration

### Files Changed
- `src/components/VideoPlayer.js` (+63/-10 lines)

### Commit
`fix(pr17): CRITICAL - Validate Infinity/NaN duration from video element`

### Prevention Strategy

**How to Avoid This in Future:**
1. **ALWAYS** validate `video.duration` with `isFinite()` and `isNaN()`
2. Never trust `value || 0` for Infinity (use `isFinite()`)
3. Fallback to stored clip duration when video element fails
4. Test with files that have problematic metadata
5. Add validation at every video.duration read point

---

### Total Time Spent
- Bug investigation: ~3 hours
- Bug fixes: ~6 hours
- Testing: ~1 hour
- **Total: ~10 hours**

### Key Lessons Learned

1. **Electron APIs Require Special Handling**
   - desktopCapturer constraints are Electron-specific
   - IPC can't transfer Blobs directly (need ArrayBuffer)
   - File permissions are platform-specific

2. **WebM Files Are Problematic**
   - FFprobe often fails to read duration
   - HTML5 video element returns Infinity initially
   - Need multi-method fallback (FFprobe → video element → seek-to-end → durationchange)

3. **Duration Validation Is Critical**
   - Always use `isFinite()` and `isNaN()` checks
   - `Infinity || 0` still equals `Infinity`
   - Fallback to stored clip duration when video element fails

4. **Trim-Aware Playback Requires Careful State Management**
   - Use `trimData` prop (current) not `selectedClip.trimOut` (stale)
   - Calculate trimmed duration, not full duration
   - Clamp all video time operations to trim bounds
   - Stop playback at trimOut boundary

5. **MediaRecorder Timing Is Tricky**
   - `onstop` fires before container finalization
   - Need to wait for final chunks
   - Call `requestData()` before and after stop
   - Add delays for container structure

### Prevention Recommendations

1. **Always Validate Duration Values**
   ```javascript
   const isValid = duration > 0 && isFinite(duration) && !isNaN(duration);
   ```

2. **Test Electron-Specific APIs Early**
   - Don't assume browser APIs work in Electron
   - Test IPC data transfer
   - Test file permissions

3. **Handle WebM Files Specially**
   - Always have HTML5 video element fallback
   - Handle Infinity duration gracefully
   - Use durationchange event listener
   - Try seek-to-end method

4. **Test Complete Workflows**
   - Record → Save → Import → Edit → Export
   - Test edge cases (0 duration, Infinity, trim bounds)
   - Verify export matches playback

5. **Don't Use Hardcoded Fallbacks**
   - `duration || 10` is wrong - use proper fallbacks
   - Validate data, don't assume defaults

2. ✅ Trim video → Verify playhead stops at trimOut
3. ✅ Import WebM with 0 FFprobe duration → Verify fallback works
4. ✅ Video element returns Infinity → Verify validation works
5. ✅ Drag WebM from MediaLibrary → Timeline shows correct duration

### Edge Cases to Test
- Multiple screens (source picker)
- Very long recordings (>10 minutes)
- WebM files with problematic metadata
- Trimmed clips with 0 trimIn or full trimOut
- Video element returning Infinity/NaN
- FFprobe returning 0 duration
