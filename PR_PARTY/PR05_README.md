# PR#5: Timeline Component - Quick Start

---

## TL;DR (30 seconds)

**What:** Build a visual timeline showing imported video clips horizontally with proportional widths based on duration. Users can click clips to select them for editing.

**Why:** The timeline is the central organizing element of any video editor - it shows what's been imported, allows clip selection, and connects to the player/trim/export workflow.

**Time:** 4 hours estimated

**Complexity:** MEDIUM

**Status:** üìã READY TO START

## Decision Framework (2 minutes)

### Should You Build This Now?

**Green Lights (Build it!):**
- ‚úÖ PR #2 (Import) complete with clips in state
- ‚úÖ PR #3 (Player) complete and working
- ‚úÖ You have 4+ hours available
- ‚úÖ Clear understanding of how selection should work
- ‚úÖ Excited to see visual timeline come together

**Red Lights (Skip/defer):**
- ‚ùå PR #2 not complete - No clips data to display
- ‚ùå PR #3 not complete - Can't connect to player
- ‚ùå Less than 2 hours available (won't finish in time)
- ‚ùå Confused about component communication

**Decision Aid:** If imports work but player isn't ready, you can still build the timeline and test with mock data.

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Clips Not Displaying
**Symptoms:** Timeline shows empty state even with clips  
**Cause:** Props not passed correctly  
**Solution:**
```javascript
// Check App.js - are you passing clips?
<Timeline clips={clips} />

// Add debug:
console.log('Timeline clips:', clips);
```
**Prevention:** Always check props in React DevTools

### Issue 2: Selection Not Working
**Symptoms:** Clicking clips does nothing  
**Cause:** onSelectClip not called or state not updating  
**Solution:**
```javascript
// In Timeline, verify click handler:
onClick={() => onSelectClip(clip.id)}

// In App, check handler exists:
const handleSelectClip = (clipId) => {
  console.log('Selecting clip:', clipId);
  setSelectedClipId(clipId);
};
```
**Prevention:** Add console.logs, verify state updates in DevTools

### Issue 3: Selection Not Updating Player
**Symptoms:** Clip selected but player doesn't change  
**Cause:** VideoPlayer not receiving updated clip  
**Solution:**
```javascript
// In App.js, verify passing selected clip:
const selectedClip = clips.find(c => c.id === selectedClipId);

<VideoPlayer clip={selectedClip} />
```
**Prevention:** Test prop flow from Timeline ‚Üí App ‚Üí VideoPlayer

### Issue 4: Width Calculation Broken
**Symptoms:** All clips same width or incorrect widths  
**Cause:** Division by zero or totalDuration is 0  
**Solution:**
```javascript
// Add guard:
const totalDuration = clips.reduce((sum, c) => sum + c.duration, 0) || 1;

// Check individual durations:
clips.forEach(clip => {
  console.log(clip.name, clip.duration);
});
```
**Prevention:** Validate clips data structure on import

### Issue 5: CSS Not Applying
**Symptoms:** Component renders but unstyled  
**Cause:** CSS import path or class names  
**Solution:**
```javascript
// Check import:
import './Timeline.css'; // Not '../styles/Timeline.css' if component in src/components/

// Check class names match:
className="clip-block" // In JSX
.clip-block { } // In CSS
```
**Prevention:** Use consistent naming, double-check paths

## Quick Reference

### Key Files
- `src/components/Timeline.js` - Main component (~150-200 lines)
- `src/styles/Timeline.css` - All timeline styles (~100-150 lines)
- `src/utils/timeHelpers.js` - Duration formatting (~20 lines)
- `src/App.js` - State management (add selection state)

### Key Functions
- `Timeline({ clips, selectedClipId, onSelectClip })` - Main component
- `formatDuration(seconds)` - Format seconds to MM:SS
- `handleSelectClip(clipId)` - Update selection in App state

### Key Concepts
- **Proportional widths:** `(clip.duration / totalDuration) * 100`
- **Selection state:** Lift to App.js for single source of truth
- **Empty state:** Show when clips.length === 0
- **Click handler:** Call onSelectClip with clip.id

### Useful Commands
```bash
# Start dev server
npm start

# Check React component tree
# Open React DevTools in browser

# Test clip selection
# Click clips, watch selectedClipId update

# Test player integration
# Select clip, verify player loads it
```

- [ ] Timeline shows imported clips horizontally
- [ ] Clip names and durations visible on each clip
- [ ] Clips have proportional widths based on duration
- [ ] Clicking a clip highlights it
- [ ] Only one clip can be selected at a time
- [ ] Selecting a clip loads it in the video player

## Architecture

### Data Flow
```
Timeline Component
‚Üì (clips, selectedClipId, onSelectClip props)
App.js (State Manager)
‚Üì (selectedClip prop)
VideoPlayer Component
```

### Selection Flow
```
User clicks clip
‚Üí Timeline calls onSelectClip(clip.id)
‚Üí App state: setSelectedClipId(clip.id)
‚Üí Timeline re-renders with updated selectedClipId
‚Üí VideoPlayer receives updated clip prop
‚Üí VideoPlayer loads new clip
```

---

## Testing Strategy

### Quick Tests (10 minutes)
1. **Empty state:** No clips ‚Üí See helpful message ‚úì
2. **Single clip:** Import one ‚Üí Displayed, auto-selected ‚úì
3. **Multiple clips:** Import 3+ ‚Üí All displayed proportionally ‚úì
4. **Selection:** Click clips ‚Üí Highlights, player updates ‚úì
5. **Data accuracy:** Check clip names/durations match imported files ‚úì

### Integration Tests (20 minutes)
1. Import ‚Üí Timeline updates ‚Üí Select ‚Üí Player loads ‚úì
2. Import multiple ‚Üí Select different clips ‚Üí Player updates ‚úì
3. Timeline metadata matches actual clip data ‚úì
4. Selection persists when possible ‚úì

## Help & Support

### Stuck on Something?
1. Check `PR05_TIMELINE_COMPONENT.md` for detailed explanations
2. Review similar component patterns (search GitHub for "timeline components")
3. Check React DevTools for state/props issues
4. Review console for errors

### Want to Skip Some Features?
**Can Skip:**
- Timeline metadata header (nice-to-have)
- Enhanced empty state (basic message is fine)
- Complex hover animations (simple hover is fine)

**Cannot Skip:**
- Clip display with proportional widths
- Click selection
- Visual highlight
- Connection to player

### Running Out of Time?
**Priority Order:**
1. CRITICAL: Display clips, click selection, highlight ‚úì
2. IMPORTANT: Connect to player, proportional widths ‚úì
3. NICE-TO-HAVE: Metadata header, enhanced empty state

## Motivation

**You're building the visual heart of the video editor!** üí™

This is the component that makes the app feel like a real video editor. Seeing clips appear on the timeline is satisfying, and the ability to click to select creates an intuitive workflow. You're connecting all the pieces:

- Import (PR #2) ‚Üí Provides data
- Timeline (PR #5) ‚Üí Visualizes data, enables selection
- Player (PR #3) ‚Üí Shows selected clip
- Trim (PR #6) ‚Üí Edits selected clip
- Export (PR #4) ‚Üí Outputs edited clip

The timeline is the bridge that makes everything work together.
