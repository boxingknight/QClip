# PR#8: Bug Fixes & Error Handling - Quick Start

---

## TL;DR (30 seconds)

**What:** Add comprehensive error handling, improve stability, add video metadata extraction, validate trim points, and fix memory leaks.

**Why:** After building core features, the app needs robust error handling to prevent crashes, provide helpful error messages, and ensure stability.

**Time:** 4 hours estimated

**Complexity:** MEDIUM

**Status:** üìã READY TO START

---

## Decision Framework (2 minutes)

### Should You Build This?

**Green Lights (Build it!):**
- ‚úÖ PRs #1-6 are complete (all core features working)
- ‚úÖ App is currently running and you can test changes immediately
- ‚úÖ You want a production-ready, stable application
- ‚úÖ You've encountered any errors or crashes during testing

**Red Lights (Skip/defer it!):**
- ‚ùå Previous PRs incomplete (can't test error handling without features)
- ‚ùå App doesn't run yet (fix that first)
- ‚ùå Time-constrained (<3 hours available)
- ‚ùå All features work perfectly with no errors (unlikely but possible)

**Decision Aid:** If you have an app with core features working and have encountered any errors, crashes, or unexpected behavior, you MUST build this now. It's the difference between a demo and a production app.

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: ErrorBoundary Not Catching Errors
**Symptoms:** Component errors crash the entire app

**Cause:** ErrorBoundary not wrapping the component that errors

**Solution:** 
```javascript
// Make sure ErrorBoundary wraps all components
<ErrorBoundary>
  <App />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

**Prevention:** Wrap top-level components early, test error scenarios

---

### Issue 2: Logger Shows Nothing in Production
**Symptoms:** No logs visible when in production build

**Cause:** DEBUG_MODE set to false in production

**Solution:** 
```javascript
// This is correct - production shouldn't log everything
const DEBUG_MODE = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development';
```

**Prevention:** Use `data.force` flag for critical errors that must always log

---

### Issue 3: Memory Leak Still Exists
**Symptoms:** Memory usage grows after switching clips

**Cause:** Cleanup function not properly removing event listeners or resources

**Solution:** 
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // Setup
  return () => {
    // Cleanup - must remove ALL listeners and resources
    video.removeEventListener('event', handler);
    video.pause();
    video.src = '';
    video.load();
  };
}, [dependencies]);
```

**Prevention:** Always include cleanup in useEffect, test with React DevTools profiler

---

### Issue 4: Metadata Extraction Fails
**Symptoms:** Import succeeds but no metadata extracted

**Cause:** IPC handler not properly calling ffprobe, or ffprobe not found

**Solution:** 
```javascript
// In main.js
const ffprobe = require('ffprobe-static').path;
const ffmpeg = require('ffmpeg-static').path;

const metadata = await ffprobe.ffprobe(videoPath);
```

**Prevention:** Test metadata extraction early with known video files

---

### Issue 5: Trim Validation Not Working
**Symptoms:** Can still export with invalid trim points

**Cause:** Validation not being called, or validation logic incomplete

**Solution:** 
```javascript
// Make sure to call validation
const validation = validateTrimPoints(inPoint, outPoint, duration);
if (!validation.valid) {
  showError(validation.error);
  return; // Don't proceed with invalid points
}
```

**Prevention:** Always validate before proceeding with any action

### Useful Commands
```bash
# Run in development mode (with debug logging)
npm start

# Build for production (without debug logging)
npm run build

# Test memory leaks
# Use React DevTools profiler

# Check logs
# Open browser console (dev mode)
```

## Success Metrics

**You'll know it's working when:**
- [ ] No console errors in normal usage
- [ ] ErrorBoundary catches any component errors
- [ ] All errors show user-friendly messages
- [ ] App never crashes completely
- [ ] Memory usage stays stable with multiple clips
- [ ] Metadata extracted on import
- [ ] Trim validation works correctly
- [ ] Export shows helpful error messages

**Performance Targets:**
- No memory leaks after 30 minutes of use
- Error UI renders in <100ms
- Metadata extraction <5 seconds
- No performance degradation from logging

---

## Help & Support

### Stuck?

1. **ErrorBoundary not catching:** Check that it wraps all components that can error
2. **Logger not working:** Check DEBUG_MODE constant and environment
3. **Memory leak persists:** Use React DevTools profiler to identify source
4. **Metadata extraction fails:** Check IPC handler and ffprobe path
5. **Trim validation not enforcing:** Check validation logic and UI integration

### Want to Skip Parts?

**Skip metadata extraction if time-limited:**
- Impact: Users won't see video dimensions, fps, etc.
- Workaround: Store duration only, display "Unknown" for other metadata
- Still do: Basic error handling, cleanup, validation

**Skip advanced logging if time-limited:**
- Impact: Harder to debug in production
- Workaround: Use console.log for critical errors only
- Still do: Error boundaries, user-friendly messages

**Skip memory leak testing if time-limited:**
- Impact: May have issues with long sessions
- Workaround: Basic cleanup only, manual memory check
- Still do: VideoPlayer cleanup at minimum
