## What We're Building

### [5] UI Components

| Component | Time | Priority | Impact |
|-----------|------|----------|--------|
| Modal | 45 min | HIGH | Used for export settings, text editing, transition selection |
| Toast | 30 min | HIGH | User feedback for recording, export, errors |
| ContextMenu | 30 min | MEDIUM | Right-click menus for clip operations |
| Toolbar | 30 min | HIGH | Main application controls |
| StatusBar | 15 min | MEDIUM | Real-time project information |

**Total Time:** 4 hours

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Component Library Structure
**Choice:** Hybrid approach with grouped components in ui/ folder  
**Rationale:**
- Clear organization and maintainability
- Easy to import specific components
- Scalable for future additions

**Impact:** Components organized in `src/components/ui/` with clear separation

### Decision 2: State Management Integration
**Choice:** Hybrid approach - Local state + UIContext for global UI  
**Rationale:**
- Components manage internal state
- UIContext manages global UI state (modals, toasts)
- Provides flexibility for different use cases

**Impact:** UIContext manages modal and toast state, components handle internal state

### Decision 3: Accessibility Implementation
**Choice:** Progressive accessibility - Core features first  
**Rationale:**
- Focus on keyboard navigation and focus management
- Implement ARIA attributes for screen readers
- Balance accessibility with development time

**Impact:** Good accessibility without excessive time investment

### Decision 4: Portal Rendering for Modals
**Choice:** React createPortal for modal rendering  
**Rationale:**
- Renders outside React tree to avoid z-index issues
- Proper focus management and accessibility
- Standard React pattern for modals

**Impact:** Modals render correctly with proper focus management

## Implementation Strategy

### Timeline
```
Phase 1: UIContext Foundation (1 hour)
├─ Create UIContext with modal/toast state
├─ Integrate into App component
└─ Test context provider

Phase 2: Core Components (2 hours)
├─ Modal component with portal (45 min)
├─ Toast system with auto-dismiss (30 min)
└─ ContextMenu with keyboard nav (30 min)

Phase 3: Layout Components (1 hour)
├─ Toolbar with grouped buttons (30 min)
├─ StatusBar with real-time updates (15 min)
└─ Integration into App layout (15 min)
```

### Key Principle
**Build reusable, accessible components that enable consistent UI patterns across all V2 features.**

---

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- [ ] Modal open/close: <100ms
- [ ] Toast animation: Smooth 300ms transition
- [ ] Context menu positioning: <50ms
- [ ] Zero accessibility violations
- [ ] No console errors

### Qualitative
- [ ] Components feel professional and polished
- [ ] UI interactions are intuitive
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works smoothly
- [ ] Components integrate seamlessly

## Risks Identified & Mitigated

### Risk 1: Portal Rendering Issues 🟡 MEDIUM
**Issue:** Modal not rendering or z-index conflicts  
**Mitigation:** Test portal rendering early, use React.createPortal correctly  
**Status:** Documented with solutions

### Risk 2: Focus Management Complexity 🟡 MEDIUM
**Issue:** Focus not trapped in modal or restored properly  
**Mitigation:** Implement focus trap utility, test thoroughly  
**Status:** Detailed implementation in checklist

### Risk 3: Context Menu Positioning Edge Cases 🟡 MEDIUM
**Issue:** Context menu appears in wrong location at screen edges  
**Mitigation:** Handle screen edge cases, test on different screen sizes  
**Status:** Positioning logic documented

### Risk 4: Toast Queue Performance 🟢 LOW
**Issue:** Too many toasts cause performance issues  
**Mitigation:** Limit toast count, implement cleanup  
**Status:** Auto-dismiss and cleanup implemented

**Overall Risk:** MEDIUM - Well-documented solutions for all risks

## Hot Tips

### Tip 1: Test Portal Rendering Early
**Why:** Portal issues are hard to debug later. Test createPortal integration immediately.

### Tip 2: Implement Focus Management First
**Why:** Focus management is complex and affects accessibility. Get it right early.

### Tip 3: Use UIContext for Global State Only
**Why:** Keep component-specific state local. UIContext should only manage global UI state.

### Tip 4: Test Components Individually
**Why:** Test each component in isolation before integration. Easier to debug issues.

## Go / No-Go Decision

### Go If:
- ✅ PR #11 (State Management Refactor) complete
- ✅ UIContext pattern established
- ✅ Need reusable UI components for V2 features
- ✅ Have 4+ hours available
- ✅ Want consistent, accessible UI patterns

### No-Go If:
- ❌ PR #11 not complete (UIContext dependency)
- ❌ Time-constrained (<3 hours)
- ❌ Want to skip UI polish for MVP
- ❌ Prefer individual component implementation

**Decision Aid:** This is foundational for V2 - if you're building V2 features, you need these components. Skip only if you're staying with MVP functionality.

---

## Immediate Next Actions

### Pre-Flight (5 minutes)
- [ ] Verify PR #11 complete
- [ ] Check UIContext exists and works
- [ ] Create feature branch
- [ ] Verify React version supports createPortal

### Day 1 Goals (4 hours)
- [ ] Phase 1: UIContext Foundation (1h)
- [ ] Phase 2: Core Components (2h)
- [ ] Phase 3: Layout Components (1h)
- [ ] Integration and testing

**Checkpoint:** Complete UI component library working and integrated

---

## Conclusion

**Planning Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Confidence Level:** HIGH  
**Recommendation:** Build it - This is essential foundation for V2 features

**Next Step:** When ready, start with Phase 1 (UIContext Foundation).

---

**You've got this!** 💪

This PR creates the foundation for all V2 features. Every advanced feature (recording, multi-track, effects) will use these components. Building them now means consistent, professional UI across the entire application.

The components you're building are:
- **Modal**: Used for export settings, text editing, transition selection
- **Toast**: Used for recording feedback, export progress, error messages
- **ContextMenu**: Used for clip operations (right-click menus)
- **Toolbar**: Used for main application controls
- **StatusBar**: Used for real-time project information

*"Build reusable components now, save time on every V2 feature later."*
