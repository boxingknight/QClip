## Bug #1: Dependencies in Wrong Section

**Severity:** ðŸ”´ CRITICAL  
**Time to Find:** 5 minutes  
**Time to Fix:** 2 minutes  
**Impact:** Build process completely failed

### The Issue

**What Went Wrong:**
`electron-builder` failed with error: `Package "electron" is only allowed in "devDependencies"`

**Error Message:**
```
Error: Package "electron" is only allowed in "devDependencies". It was moved to "devDependencies".
```

**User Impact:**
- Build process failed completely
- No DMG could be created
- Development workflow blocked

### Root Cause Analysis

**Surface Issue:**
`electron-builder` validation error

**Actual Cause:**
`electron` and `electron-builder` were listed in `dependencies` instead of `devDependencies` in `package.json`

**Why It Matters:**
`electron-builder` enforces this rule to prevent Electron from being bundled in production apps

### The Fix

**Before (Broken):**
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "electron": "^38.4.0",
    "electron-builder": "^25.1.8"
  }
}
```

**After (Fixed):**
```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "electron": "^38.4.0",
    "electron-builder": "^25.1.8"
  }
}
```

### Files Changed
- `package.json` (moved electron and electron-builder to devDependencies)

### Commit
`fix(packaging): move electron and electron-builder to devDependencies`

### Prevention Strategy

**How to Avoid This in Future:**
1. Always check `package.json` dependencies before packaging
2. Use `npm install --save-dev electron electron-builder` for new projects
3. Add linting rule to catch this

**Test to Add:**
```bash
# Pre-build validation
if npm list electron --depth=0 | grep -q "dependencies"; then
  echo "ERROR: electron should be in devDependencies"
  exit 1
fi
```

## Bug #2: Incorrect FFprobe Path Configuration

**Severity:** ðŸ”´ CRITICAL  
**Time to Find:** 10 minutes  
**Time to Fix:** 5 minutes  
**Impact:** FFprobe binary not found during packaging

### The Issue

**What Went Wrong:**
`electron-builder` couldn't find FFprobe binary at specified path

**Error Message:**
```
file source doesn't exist from=/Users/loganmay/QClip/node_modules/ffprobe-static/ffprobe
```

**User Impact:**
- Packaging failed
- FFprobe binary not bundled
- Video processing would fail in packaged app

### Root Cause Analysis

**Surface Issue:**
File path doesn't exist

**Actual Cause:**
`ffprobe-static` structure is `bin/darwin/arch/ffprobe`, not just `ffprobe`

**Why It Matters:**
`electron-builder` needs exact paths to bundle binaries correctly

### The Fix

**Before (Broken):**
```yaml
extraResources:
  - from: "node_modules/ffprobe-static/ffprobe"
    to: "ffprobe"
```

**After (Fixed):**
```yaml
extraResources:
  - from: "node_modules/ffprobe-static/bin/darwin/arm64/ffprobe"
    to: "ffprobe-arm64"
  - from: "node_modules/ffprobe-static/bin/darwin/x64/ffprobe"
    to: "ffprobe-x64"
```

### Files Changed
- `electron-builder.yml` (corrected FFprobe paths)

### Commit
`fix(packaging): correct FFprobe binary paths for electron-builder`

### Prevention Strategy

**How to Avoid This in Future:**
1. Always inspect `node_modules` structure before configuring paths
2. Use `find node_modules -name "ffprobe"` to locate binaries
3. Test packaging early in development

**Test to Add:**
```bash
# Verify binary paths exist
for path in "node_modules/ffprobe-static/bin/darwin/arm64/ffprobe" "node_modules/ffprobe-static/bin/darwin/x64/ffprobe"; do
  if [ ! -f "$path" ]; then
    echo "ERROR: Binary not found at $path"
    exit 1
  fi
done
```

## Bug #3: Code Signing Failure

**Severity:** ðŸŸ¡ HIGH  
**Time to Find:** 5 minutes  
**Time to Fix:** 2 minutes  
**Impact:** App couldn't be opened due to Gatekeeper

### The Issue

**What Went Wrong:**
Code signing failed during packaging

**Error Message:**
```
The timestamp service is not available.
```

**User Impact:**
- Packaged app couldn't be opened
- macOS Gatekeeper blocked execution
- User couldn't test the app

### Root Cause Analysis

**Surface Issue:**
Timestamp service unavailable

**Actual Cause:**
Apple Developer account or network issues with code signing

**Why It Matters:**
macOS requires signed apps for distribution

### The Fix

**Before (Broken):**
```yaml
mac:
  identity: "Apple Development: loganliangmay@icloud.com"
  hardenedRuntime: true
  gatekeeperAssess: true
```

**After (Fixed):**
```yaml
mac:
  identity: null  # Skip signing for MVP
  hardenedRuntime: false
  gatekeeperAssess: false
```

### Files Changed
- `electron-builder.yml` (disabled code signing for MVP)

### Commit
`fix(packaging): disable code signing for MVP to avoid timestamp issues`

### Prevention Strategy

**How to Avoid This in Future:**
1. Set up proper Apple Developer account for production
2. Use local signing certificates for development
3. Add retry logic for timestamp service failures

**Test to Add:**
```bash
# Check if app can be opened without signing
codesign -v --deep --strict dist/mac-arm64/ClipForge.app
```

## Bug #4: FFmpeg Binaries Inside ASAR Archive (spawn ENOTDIR)

**Severity:** ðŸ”´ CRITICAL  
**Time to Find:** 1 hour  
**Time to Fix:** 30 minutes  
**Impact:** FFmpeg execution failed with spawn ENOTDIR error

### The Issue

**What Went Wrong:**
FFmpeg binaries were bundled inside ASAR archive and couldn't be executed

**Error Message:**
```
spawn ENOTDIR
```

**User Impact:**
- Video trimming completely broken
- Export functionality failed
- Core features unusable in packaged app

### Root Cause Analysis

**Surface Issue:**
`spawn ENOTDIR` error when calling FFmpeg

**Actual Cause:**
Binaries inside ASAR archive are not executable - Electron can't spawn them

**Why It Matters:**
ASAR archives are read-only and binaries inside them lose executable permissions

### The Fix

**Before (Broken):**
```yaml
# No asarUnpack configuration
# Binaries bundled inside ASAR archive
```

**After (Fixed):**
```yaml
# Extract binaries from ASAR - CRITICAL: binaries inside ASAR can't be executed!
asarUnpack:
  - "electron/ffmpeg/videoProcessing.js"
```

**Additional Fix - Path Resolution:**
```javascript
// Added fallback path resolution
function getFFmpegPaths() {
  const isPackaged = !!process.resourcesPath;
  
  if (isPackaged) {
    // Try extraResources first
    const extraResourcesPath = path.join(process.resourcesPath, 'ffmpeg');
    if (fs.existsSync(extraResourcesPath)) {
      return {
        ffmpeg: extraResourcesPath,
        ffprobe: path.join(process.resourcesPath, 'ffprobe-x64')
      };
    }
    
    // Fallback to ASAR unpacked location
    const asarPath = path.join(process.resourcesPath, 'app.asar.unpacked', 'electron', 'ffmpeg');
    if (fs.existsSync(asarPath)) {
      return {
        ffmpeg: path.join(asarPath, 'ffmpeg'),
        ffprobe: path.join(asarPath, 'ffprobe')
      };
    }
  }
}
```

### Files Changed
- `electron-builder.yml` (added asarUnpack)
- `electron/ffmpeg/videoProcessing.js` (added fallback path resolution)

### Commit
`fix(packaging): add ASAR unpack and fallback path resolution for binaries`

### Prevention Strategy

**How to Avoid This in Future:**
1. **ALWAYS** use `asarUnpack` for any executable binaries
2. Test binary execution in packaged app early
3. Add logging to verify binary paths and executability
4. Use `extraResources` for binaries, not `files`

**Test to Add:**
```bash
# Verify binaries are executable in packaged app
codesign -v --deep --strict dist/mac-arm64/ClipForge.app/Contents/Resources/ffmpeg
codesign -v --deep --strict dist/mac-arm64/ClipForge.app/Contents/Resources/ffprobe-x64
```

**Linting Rule:**
```javascript
// ESLint rule to catch binaries in files array
if (config.files && config.files.some(f => f.includes('ffmpeg') || f.includes('ffprobe'))) {
  console.warn('WARNING: Binaries should use extraResources, not files');
}
```

## Bug #5: Duplicate Variable Declaration

**Severity:** ðŸŸ  MEDIUM  
**Time to Find:** 5 minutes  
**Time to Fix:** 1 minute  
**Impact:** App crashed on startup

### The Issue

**What Went Wrong:**
JavaScript syntax error due to duplicate `const isDev` declaration

**Error Message:**
```
SyntaxError: Identifier 'isDev' has already been declared
```

**User Impact:**
- App crashed immediately on launch
- No functionality available

### Root Cause Analysis

**Surface Issue:**
JavaScript syntax error

**Actual Cause:**
`const isDev` declared twice in the same function scope

**Why It Matters:**
JavaScript doesn't allow duplicate variable declarations in same scope

### The Fix

**Before (Broken):**
```javascript
function getFFmpegPaths() {
  const isDev = !process.env.NODE_ENV || process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development';
  // ... other code ...
  const isDev = !isPackaged || process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'; // DUPLICATE!
}
```

**After (Fixed):**
```javascript
function getFFmpegPaths() {
  const isPackaged = !!process.resourcesPath;
  const isDev = !isPackaged || process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development';
  // ... rest of function
}
```

### Files Changed
- `electron/ffmpeg/videoProcessing.js` (removed duplicate declaration)

### Commit
`fix(packaging): remove duplicate isDev declaration`

### Prevention Strategy

**How to Avoid This in Future:**
1. Use ESLint to catch duplicate declarations
2. Review code before committing
3. Use consistent variable naming

**Linting Rule:**
```javascript
// ESLint rule: no-redeclare
"no-redeclare": "error"
```
