## What We're Building

### [4] Major Features

| Feature | Time | Priority | Impact |
|---------|------|----------|--------|
| Device Enumeration | 1.5h | HIGH | Essential for multi-camera support |
| Preview System | 2h | HIGH | Professional UX, proper framing |

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Webcam Source Selection
**Choice:** Webcam picker with device enumeration  
**Rationale:**
- Professional video editing software always shows device selection
- Users often have multiple cameras (built-in + external)
- Better UX than guessing which camera to use
- Consistent with screen recording approach (PR#17)

**Impact:** More complex implementation but professional UX

### Decision 2: Recording Format
**Choice:** WebM with optional MP4 conversion  
**Rationale:**
- WebM is ideal for web-based recording (MediaRecorder API)
- MP4 conversion ensures compatibility with all editing tools
- Consistent with screen recording approach (PR#17)
- Users can choose based on their needs

**Impact:** Optimal recording performance with broad compatibility

### Decision 3: Audio Handling
**Choice:** Microphone audio only (with system audio option in future)  
**Rationale:**
- Webcam recording is primarily for voice + video
- System audio mixing is complex and can be added later
- Focus on core functionality first
- Microphone audio is essential for webcam content

**Impact:** Simpler implementation, clear use case

### Decision 4: Preview Window
**Choice:** Resizable preview window  
**Rationale:**
- Users need to see themselves to frame the shot properly
- Resizable allows different use cases (small for monitoring, large for setup)
- Professional video editing software always shows preview
- Can be minimized when not needed

**Impact:** Professional UX with flexible sizing

## Implementation Strategy

### Timeline
```
Day 1 (3 hours):
├─ Phase 1: Device Enumeration (1.5h)
│  ├─ webcamUtils.js creation
│  └─ DeviceSelector component
└─ Phase 2: Preview System (1.5h)
   ├─ WebcamPreview component
   └─ RecordingSettings component

Day 2 (3 hours):
├─ Phase 3: Recording Implementation (2h)
│  ├─ RecordingContext extension
│  └─ WebcamRecordingControls
└─ Phase 4: Integration & Polish (1h)
   ├─ App integration
   └─ Error handling
```

### Key Principle
**Build on PR#17 foundation** - Leverage existing recording infrastructure while adding webcam-specific features.

---

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- [ ] Recording startup: < 2 seconds
- [ ] Preview latency: < 100ms
- [ ] Memory usage: < 200MB during recording
- [ ] File size: Reasonable for duration (not bloated)

### Qualitative
- [ ] Professional device selection UX
- [ ] Real-time preview for proper framing
- [ ] Seamless integration with existing workflow
- [ ] Clear error messages and recovery

## Risks Identified & Mitigated

### Risk 1: Webcam Permission Denied 🟡 MEDIUM
**Issue:** Browser security requires HTTPS or localhost for camera access  
**Mitigation:** Clear permission request UI, helpful error messages, fallback to screen recording  
**Status:** Documented with solutions

### Risk 2: Multiple Webcam Device Handling 🟢 LOW
**Issue:** Users may have multiple cameras, need to handle device changes  
**Mitigation:** Robust device enumeration, clear device selection UI, handle device changes  
**Status:** Well-planned with device enumeration

### Risk 3: Browser Compatibility Issues 🟡 MEDIUM
**Issue:** WebRTC APIs may not be supported in all browsers  
**Mitigation:** Feature detection, fallback codecs, clear error messages  
**Status:** Documented with compatibility notes

### Risk 4: Performance During Recording 🟢 LOW
**Issue:** Recording may impact system performance  
**Mitigation:** Optimize MediaRecorder settings, monitor memory usage, provide quality options  
**Status:** Performance targets defined

**Overall Risk:** MEDIUM - WebRTC APIs are well-supported but require careful error handling

## Hot Tips

### Tip 1: Test on HTTPS Early
**Why:** getUserMedia API requires secure context (HTTPS or localhost)

### Tip 2: Handle Permission States
**Why:** Users may deny permission, need graceful fallbacks

### Tip 3: Clean Up Streams Properly
**Why:** MediaStreams consume resources, must be cleaned up

### Tip 4: Use Feature Detection
**Why:** Not all browsers support all MediaRecorder codecs

## Go / No-Go Decision

### Go If:
- ✅ You have 6+ hours available
- ✅ PR#17 (Screen Recording Setup) is complete
- ✅ You want comprehensive recording capabilities
- ✅ You're comfortable with WebRTC APIs

### No-Go If:
- ❌ Time-constrained (<6 hours)
- ❌ PR#17 not complete (missing foundation)
- ❌ Not interested in webcam recording
- ❌ WebRTC APIs seem too complex

**Decision Aid:** This completes ClipForge's recording suite. High value but requires solid WebRTC understanding.

---

## Immediate Next Actions

### Pre-Flight (5 minutes)
- [ ] Prerequisites checked (PR#17 complete)
- [ ] HTTPS/localhost environment verified
- [ ] Webcam device available for testing

### Day 1 Goals (3 hours)
- [ ] Read full specification (45 min)
- [ ] Set up environment (15 min)
- [ ] Start Phase 1: Device Enumeration (1.5h)
- [ ] Complete Phase 2: Preview System (1.5h)

**Checkpoint:** Users can see webcam preview and select devices

---

## Conclusion

**Planning Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Confidence Level:** HIGH  
**Recommendation:** Build it! High-value feature that completes recording suite

**Next Step:** When ready, start with Phase 1 (Device Enumeration).

**You've got this!** 💪

This PR transforms ClipForge into a complete capture-and-edit solution. Combined with screen recording (PR#17), users can now record any type of content they need. The WebRTC APIs are well-documented and the implementation builds on solid foundations.
