## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Recording API Choice
**Choice:** Electron desktopCapturer + MediaRecorder  
**Rationale:**
- Native Electron API provides screen source selection
- MediaRecorder is standard Web API with broad support
- No additional dependencies required
- Good performance and reliability

**Impact:** Reliable recording infrastructure that works across Electron versions

### Decision 2: Recording Format
**Choice:** Record to WebM, convert to MP4 if needed  
**Rationale:**
- WebM has excellent browser support for MediaRecorder
- Can convert to MP4 using FFmpeg during save
- Reliable across different Electron versions

**Impact:** Consistent recording format with optional MP4 conversion

### Decision 3: State Management
**Choice:** RecordingContext with Media Library integration  
**Rationale:**
- Consistent with existing architecture (PR#11)
- Clear separation of concerns (recording vs. editing)
- Easy integration with MediaLibraryContext

**Impact:** Scalable architecture that follows established patterns

### Decision 4: Source Selection UX
**Choice:** Source picker dialog with "Remember choice" option  
**Rationale:**
- Professional recording tools offer source selection
- Users may want different sources (entire screen, specific window, application audio only)
- "Remember choice" provides convenience for repeated use

**Impact:** Professional UX matching industry standards (OBS, QuickTime)

### Decision 5: Recording Indicator
**Choice:** In-app indicator + window title badge  
**Rationale:**
- In-app indicator shows recording state clearly
- Window title badge ensures visibility even when app is in background
- Simple to implement
- Professional appearance

**Impact:** Clear visual feedback during recording

## Implementation Strategy

### Timeline
```
Day 1 (3 hours):
├─ Phase 1: Electron API Setup (1.5h)
│   ├─ IPC handler for screen sources
│   ├─ Preload API exposure
│   └─ Permission handling
└─ Phase 2: RecordingContext Foundation (1.5h)
    ├─ State structure setup
    └─ getAvailableSources action

Day 2 (3 hours):
├─ Phase 2: RecordingContext Complete (1.5h)
│   ├─ startRecording action
│   ├─ stopRecording action
│   └─ saveRecording action
└─ Phase 3: UI Components (1.5h)
    ├─ RecordingControls component
    └─ SourcePicker component

Day 3 (1 hour):
├─ Phase 3: UI Components Complete (30 min)
│   ├─ RecordingIndicator
│   └─ Toolbar integration
└─ Phase 4: Integration & Testing (30 min)
    ├─ App integration
    ├─ Media Library integration
    └─ End-to-end testing
```

### Key Principle
**Test Early:** Verify Electron desktopCapturer access on Day 1 to avoid permission issues blocking development.

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- [ ] Recording start time: < 2 seconds
- [ ] Frame rate: ~30fps maintained
- [ ] Memory usage: < 500MB during recording
- [ ] File size: < 50MB per minute (high quality)

### Qualitative
- [ ] Users can record screen with source selection
- [ ] Recording indicator clearly visible
- [ ] Recorded videos appear in Media Library
- [ ] Error messages are helpful and actionable

## Risks Identified & Mitigated

### Risk 1: Permission Denied 🟡 MEDIUM
**Issue:** macOS screen recording permission not granted  
**Mitigation:** 
- Clear permission request UI
- Helpful error messages with instructions
- Test permission flow early
**Status:** Documented, needs testing

### Risk 2: MediaRecorder Codec Support 🟡 MEDIUM
**Issue:** Browser may not support preferred codec  
**Mitigation:**
- Feature detection before recording
- Fallback codecs (vp8, h264)
- Conversion to MP4 post-recording if needed
**Status:** Documented, needs testing

### Risk 3: Performance Issues 🟢 LOW
**Issue:** High memory usage or frame drops  
**Mitigation:**
- Optimize MediaRecorder settings
- Monitor memory usage
- Add performance metrics
**Status:** Documented, monitoring plan in place

**Overall Risk:** 🟡 MEDIUM - Permission and codec issues need early testing

---

## Hot Tips

### Tip 1: Test Permissions Early
**Why:** macOS screen recording permission can block development if not configured. Test in first 15 minutes.

### Tip 2: Use Feature Detection
**Why:** MediaRecorder support varies. Always check `MediaRecorder.isTypeSupported()` before creating instance.

### Tip 3: Monitor Memory During Recording
**Why:** Video chunks accumulate in memory. Monitor usage and warn users about system resources.

### Tip 4: Save Chunks Periodically
**Why:** Instead of accumulating all chunks in memory, consider streaming to file for long recordings.

## Go / No-Go Decision

### Go If:
- ✅ PR #11 (State Management) complete
- ✅ PR #12 (UI Components) complete
- ✅ PR #13 (Professional Timeline) complete
- ✅ Have 6+ hours available
- ✅ Can test on macOS (required for Electron desktopCapturer)
- ✅ Excited about recording features

### No-Go If:
- ❌ Prerequisites incomplete
- ❌ Time-constrained (<6 hours)
- ❌ Cannot test on macOS
- ❌ Other priorities (bug fixes, critical features)
- ❌ Not interested in recording functionality

**Decision Aid:** This is foundational for PR#18 (Webcam) and PR#19 (Audio Mixing). If you plan to build those features, this PR is essential. If recording isn't a priority, you can defer.

## Immediate Next Actions

### Pre-Flight (5 minutes)
- [ ] Prerequisites checked (PR#11, PR#12, PR#13)
- [ ] macOS screen recording permission configured
- [ ] Branch created: `feature/pr17-screen-recording`

### Day 1 Goals (3 hours)
- [ ] Read full specification (30 min)
- [ ] Set up environment (15 min)
- [ ] Phase 1: Electron API Setup (1.5h)
  - [ ] IPC handler for screen sources
  - [ ] Preload API exposure
  - [ ] Permission handling
- [ ] Phase 2: RecordingContext Foundation (1.5h)
  - [ ] State structure setup
  - [ ] getAvailableSources action

**Checkpoint:** Can get screen sources and display them

## Conclusion

**Planning Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Confidence Level:** HIGH  
**Recommendation:** **BUILD IT** ✅

Screen recording infrastructure is foundational for V2's recording capabilities. Comprehensive planning documents provide clear implementation path with risk mitigation strategies. Key decisions favor reliability and professional UX over complexity.

**Next Step:** When ready, start with Phase 1 (Electron API Setup).

**You've got this!** 💪

ClipForge already has professional timeline editing and drag-and-drop. Adding screen recording transforms it into a complete capture-and-edit solution. This is the foundation that enables webcam recording, audio mixing, and advanced recording features in future PRs.
