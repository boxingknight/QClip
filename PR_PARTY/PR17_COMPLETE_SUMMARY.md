# PR#17: Screen Recording Setup - Complete Summary

**Date Completed:** October 29, 2024  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE & DEPLOYED  
**Timeline:** ~12 hours actual (6 hours estimated)  
**Priority:** HIGH - Key V2 feature  
**Complexity:** HIGH  
**Dependencies:** PR #11 (State Management Refactor), PR #12 (UI Component Library), PR #13 (Professional Timeline) ✅

## Executive Summary

Screen recording functionality successfully implemented using Electron's `desktopCapturer` API and Web `MediaRecorder` API. Users can record their screen, select from multiple sources, and save recordings directly to the Media Library. Recorded WebM files are fully supported for import and editing. All critical bugs resolved, including WebM duration extraction, trim-aware playback, and Infinity duration handling.

**Key Achievement:** ClipForge now provides a complete capture-and-edit workflow - users can record, import, edit, and export without leaving the application.

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

**Recording Pipeline:**
```
User clicks Record → Source Picker → getUserMedia → MediaRecorder → Chunks → Blob → ArrayBuffer → IPC → File Save → Media Library
```

**Duration Extraction Pipeline:**
```
Import → FFprobe (duration: 0?) → HTML5 Video Element → Infinity? → Seek-to-End → DurationChange Event → Valid Duration
```

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **Electron desktopCapturer + MediaRecorder** ✅
   - Native APIs, no dependencies
   - Good performance, reliable
   - Works across Electron versions

2. **WebM Format** ✅
   - MediaRecorder default output
   - Excellent browser support
   - Quality preservation

3. **WebM Import Support** ✅
   - Easier than conversion
   - Faster workflow
   - No quality loss

4. **Multi-Method Duration Fallback** ✅
   - FFprobe primary
   - HTML5 video element secondary
   - Seek-to-end trick
   - DurationChange event listener

5. **Trim-Aware Playback** ✅
   - Use trimData prop (current state)
   - Calculate trimmed duration
   - Clamp all operations to trim bounds

## Key Lessons Learned

### Technical Lessons

1. **Electron APIs Require Special Handling**
   - desktopCapturer needs specific constraint format
   - IPC can't transfer Blobs (must use ArrayBuffer)
   - File permissions are platform-specific

2. **WebM Duration Extraction Is Complex**
   - FFprobe often fails (returns 0)
   - HTML5 video element returns Infinity initially
   - Need multi-method fallback (4 methods!)
   - DurationChange event is critical

3. **Duration Validation Is Essential**
   - Always use `isFinite()` and `isNaN()`
   - `Infinity || 0` still equals `Infinity`
   - Validate at every video.duration read point
   - Fallback to stored clip duration

4. **MediaRecorder Timing Matters**
   - `onstop` fires before final chunks
   - Need to wait for container finalization
   - Call `requestData()` before and after stop
   - Add delays for structure completion

5. **Trim-Aware Systems Require Careful State**
   - Use current trimData, not stale clip.trimOut
   - Calculate trimmed duration everywhere
   - Clamp all operations to trim bounds
   - Stop playback at boundaries

### Process Lessons

1. **Test Electron-Specific APIs Early**
   - Don't assume browser APIs work
   - Test IPC data transfer
   - Test file permissions

2. **Handle Edge Cases Proactively**
   - Infinity, NaN, 0 durations
   - Multiple screens
   - Trim boundaries
   - Format mismatches

3. **Document Bugs Comprehensively**
   - Root cause analysis
   - Prevention strategies
   - Future reference

4. **Test Complete Workflows**
   - Record → Save → Import → Edit → Export
   - Verify end-to-end functionality
   - Check all edge cases
