## What We're Building

### Features

| Feature | Time | Priority | Impact |
|---------|------|----------|--------|
| Split Clip at Playhead | 1 h | HIGH | Essential editing operation |
| Delete Clip | 0.5 h | HIGH | Essential editing operation |
| Context Menu | 2 h | HIGH | Discoverability and UX |
| Keyboard Shortcuts | 1 h | MEDIUM | Power user efficiency |
| Toolbar Integration | 0 h | LOW | Already exists from PR#12 |

**Total Time:** 4.5 hours core + 1.5 hours testing = 6 hours

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Non-Destructive Split Approach
**Choice:** Use trim points approach (not file splitting)  
**Rationale:**
- Instant operation (no file processing)
- Undo-friendly (can easily reverse)
- Storage efficient (no duplicate files)
- Industry standard approach

**Impact:** Split operations are instant and maintain timeline integrity

### Decision 2: Multi-Select Delete Support
**Choice:** Delete all selected clips at once (array-based)  
**Rationale:**
- Professional workflow (bulk operations)
- Simple implementation (loop through array)
- Works with existing multi-select (Cmd+Click)

**Impact:** Users can efficiently delete multiple clips in one operation

### Decision 3: Portal-Based Context Menu
**Choice:** Reuse ContextMenu component from PR#12  
**Rationale:**
- Consistency across app
- Proven portal architecture
- Accessibility support built-in
- Discoverability (right-click)

**Impact:** Professional UX with proper z-index management

### Decision 4: Split at Playhead Only
**Choice:** Split at playhead position (not click position)  
**Rationale:**
- Industry standard (CapCut, Premiere Pro use ‚åòB)
- Precision through visible playhead
- Simpler UX (single method)

**Impact:** Familiar workflow for users from other editors

## Implementation Strategy

### Timeline
```
Phase 1: Split Reducer (1 hour)
‚îú‚îÄ Add SPLIT_CLIP action
‚îú‚îÄ Calculate split time
‚îî‚îÄ Create first and second clips

Phase 2: Delete Reducer (30 min)
‚îú‚îÄ Add REMOVE_CLIP action
‚îî‚îÄ Filter out deleted clip

Phase 3: Context Menu (2 hours)
‚îú‚îÄ Create ClipContextMenu component
‚îú‚îÄ Style context menu
‚îî‚îÄ Integrate into Clip component

Phase 4: Keyboard Shortcuts (1 hour)
‚îú‚îÄ Add split shortcut (Cmd+B)
‚îú‚îÄ Add delete shortcut (Delete)
‚îî‚îÄ Add duplicate shortcut (Cmd+D)

Phase 5: Integration (1.5 hours)
‚îú‚îÄ Verify toolbar integration
‚îú‚îÄ Comprehensive testing
‚îî‚îÄ Bug fixes
```

### Key Principle
"Simple operations, proven patterns, professional UX"

- Simple reducer operations (filter, map)
- Reuse patterns from PR#12 and PR#13
- Professional keyboard shortcuts
- Portal-based context menu

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- [ ] Split operation < 100ms (instant)
- [ ] Delete operation < 50ms (instant)
- [ ] Context menu < 50ms open time
- [ ] Keyboard shortcut response < 100ms
- [ ] Zero critical bugs

### Qualitative
- [ ] Split feels instant and responsive
- [ ] Delete works smoothly with multi-select
- [ ] Context menu discoverable and accessible
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts feel natural
- [ ] Undo/redo works for all operations

## Risks Identified & Mitigated

### Risk 1: Split Time Calculation Error üü¢ LOW
**Issue:** Using absolute time instead of relative time  
**Mitigation:** Document calculation: `splitTime - clip.startTime`  
**Status:** Documented with code examples

### Risk 2: Context Menu Positioning üü¢ LOW
**Issue:** Menu appearing in wrong location  
**Mitigation:** Use portal pattern from PR#12, store click coordinates  
**Status:** Pattern proven in PR#12

### Risk 3: Multi-Select Delete Performance üü¢ LOW
**Issue:** Performance with large selection arrays  
**Mitigation:** Simple filter operation (O(n)), batch updates  
**Status:** Low risk, simple operation

### Risk 4: Undo/Redo Integration üü¢ LOW
**Issue:** Operations not undoable  
**Mitigation:** Use saveState() before operations (already in useTimeline)  
**Status:** Already integrated

**Overall Risk:** üü¢ LOW - Solid foundation, simple operations, proven patterns

## Hot Tips

### Tip 1: Use Relative Split Time
**Why:** Calculate split time relative to clip start for duration calculations  
**Code:**
```javascript
const splitTime = action.splitTime - originalClip.startTime;
```

### Tip 2: Reuse Portal Pattern
**Why:** Portal rendering ensures proper z-index (learned from PR#12)  
**Code:** Use ContextMenu component or similar portal pattern

### Tip 3: Validate Before Operations
**Why:** Prevent invalid splits (playhead must be on clip)  
**Code:**
```javascript
const canSplit = playhead > clip.startTime && 
                 playhead < clip.startTime + clip.duration;
```

### Tip 4: Loop for Multi-Select
**Why:** Delete/duplicate should work with multiple clips  
**Code:**
```javascript
selection.clips.forEach(clipId => removeClip(clipId));
```

## Go / No-Go Decision

### Go If:
- ‚úÖ PR #11-#14 complete and stable
- ‚úÖ Timeline working correctly
- ‚úÖ Context menu component exists (PR#12)
- ‚úÖ You have 4-6 hours available
- ‚úÖ Ready to build professional editing operations

### No-Go If:
- ‚ùå Timeline has critical bugs (fix first)
- ‚ùå Context menu component doesn't exist (prerequisite)
- ‚ùå Time-constrained (<4 hours)

**Decision Aid:** Split and delete are fundamental operations. Only defer if foundation has critical bugs.

## Immediate Next Actions

### Pre-Flight (5 minutes)
- [ ] Prerequisites checked (PR #11-#14)
- [ ] Timeline working correctly
- [ ] Branch created: `feature/pr15-split-delete-clips`

### Day 1 Goals (4-6 hours)
- [ ] Phase 1: Split reducer (1 hour)
- [ ] Phase 2: Delete reducer (30 min)
- [ ] Phase 3: Context menu (2 hours)
- [ ] Phase 4: Keyboard shortcuts (1 hour)
- [ ] Phase 5: Integration & testing (1.5 hours)

**Checkpoint:** Split and delete operations working ‚úì

## Conclusion

**Planning Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Confidence Level:** HIGH  
**Recommendation:** BUILD IT

Solid foundation from PR#13, proven patterns from PR#12, simple operations (filter, map), professional keyboard shortcuts. This should be a smooth implementation.

**Next Step:** When ready, start with Phase 1 from checklist.
