## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Modal Dialog UI
**Choice:** Modal dialog with expandable sections  
**Rationale:**
- Provides space for comprehensive settings without cluttering UI
- Matches professional video editor patterns (Premiere, Final Cut)
- Can show real-time preview and file size estimates
- One extra click is acceptable for professional settings

**Impact:** Professional UX, comprehensive settings display

### Decision 2: Hybrid Preset + Custom System
**Choice:** Preset system with custom overrides  
**Rationale:**
- Presets provide safe, tested configurations for common use cases
- Custom overrides allow power users to fine-tune settings
- Easier to maintain and debug than pure dynamic building
- Can validate settings against FFmpeg capabilities

**Impact:** Flexibility for all users, maintainable codebase

### Decision 3: localStorage Persistence
**Choice:** localStorage with project-level override capability  
**Rationale:**
- Users expect settings to persist between sessions
- localStorage is simple and reliable
- Can upgrade to project files later without breaking changes
- Good balance of convenience and flexibility

**Impact:** Better user experience, seamless workflow

### Decision 4: Context API Integration
**Choice:** ExportContext separate from ProjectContext  
**Rationale:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Can reuse ExportContext independently
- Follows established patterns from PR #11
- Easier to test and maintain

**Impact:** Clean architecture, maintainable code

## Implementation Strategy

### Timeline
```
Phase 1: Foundation (1.5 hours)
├─ ExportContext creation
├─ Settings utilities
└─ Persistence setup

Phase 2: UI Components (2 hours)
├─ ExportSettingsModal
├─ BasicSettings
├─ PresetSelector
└─ FileSizeEstimator

Phase 3: Advanced Settings (1.5 hours)
├─ AdvancedSettings component
├─ Codec/bitrate controls
└─ Modal integration

Phase 4: FFmpeg Integration (1 hour)
├─ Command building
├─ Settings application
└─ Validation
```

### Key Principle
**Test each phase before moving to the next.** Settings must work correctly before FFmpeg integration. Export must work with all preset configurations.

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- [ ] Modal open time: < 200ms
- [ ] Settings update: < 50ms
- [ ] File size calculation: < 10ms
- [ ] Export with custom settings: < 2x video duration
- [ ] All presets produce valid exports

### Qualitative
- [ ] Settings UI feels professional
- [ ] Presets meet common use case needs
- [ ] Error messages are helpful
- [ ] Workflow is intuitive

## Risks Identified & Mitigated

### Risk 1: FFmpeg Command Complexity 🟡 MEDIUM
**Issue:** Complex FFmpeg commands may fail with invalid parameters  
**Mitigation:** 
- Use preset system with tested configurations
- Comprehensive settings validation
- Error handling with helpful messages
- Test each preset extensively
**Status:** Documented, mitigation plan ready

### Risk 2: Settings State Management 🟢 LOW
**Issue:** State management complexity across context and localStorage  
**Mitigation:**
- Use proven Context API pattern from PR #11
- Clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive testing
**Status:** Low risk, proven pattern

### Risk 3: File Size Estimation Accuracy 🟡 MEDIUM
**Issue:** Estimates may be inaccurate, confusing users  
**Mitigation:**
- Use conservative estimates
- Test with various video types
- Show note that estimate is approximate
**Status:** Documented, acceptable margin of error (±10%)

### Risk 4: UI Complexity 🟢 LOW
**Issue:** Too many settings may overwhelm users  
**Mitigation:**
- Use expandable sections (progressive disclosure)
- Clear labeling and help text
- Preset system for common use cases
- Basic settings visible first
**Status:** Low risk, good UX patterns

**Overall Risk:** 🟢 LOW - Well-understood patterns, proven architecture

## Hot Tips

### Tip 1: Test FFmpeg Commands Manually First
**Why:** FFmpeg commands are complex. Test each preset manually before integrating to catch issues early.

### Tip 2: Start with Presets, Add Custom Later
**Why:** Presets provide immediate value with lower complexity. Custom settings can be added incrementally.

### Tip 3: Validate Settings Aggressively
**Why:** Invalid FFmpeg parameters cause cryptic errors. Catch them early with validation to provide helpful messages.

### Tip 4: Show File Size Estimates Prominently
**Why:** Users care about file size. Real-time estimates help them make informed decisions about quality vs size trade-offs.

## Go / No-Go Decision

### Go If:
- ✅ PRs #11-16 complete (foundation ready)
- ✅ Have 4-6 hours available
- ✅ Want professional export capabilities
- ✅ FFmpeg working correctly
- ✅ Modal system from PR #12 working

### No-Go If:
- ❌ Previous PRs not complete
- ❌ Time-constrained (<4 hours)
- ❌ Basic export sufficient for now
- ❌ FFmpeg not working

**Decision Aid:** This is essential for professional video editor. If you have the foundation and time, build it. If not, complete prerequisites first.

## Conclusion

**Planning Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Confidence Level:** HIGH  
**Recommendation:** **BUILD IT** - Well-planned, clear implementation path, essential for professional video editor

**Next Step:** When ready, start with Phase 1: Export Settings Foundation.

**You've got this!** 💪

ClipForge already has a solid foundation with professional timeline, drag & drop, and split/delete functionality. Adding advanced export settings transforms it into a truly professional video editor that rivals Premiere Pro and Final Cut Pro. Users will be able to export videos optimized for different platforms with full control over quality, format, and encoding options.
