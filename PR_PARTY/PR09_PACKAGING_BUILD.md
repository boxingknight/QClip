# PR#9: Packaging & Build

**Estimated Time:** 2-4 hours  
**Complexity:** MEDIUM  
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Day 2, Hours 35-36  
**Branch:** `feat/packaging`  
**Dependencies:** PR #1-8 (All core features must be complete)

---

## Overview

### What We're Building
Package ClipForge as a distributable desktop application for macOS using Electron Builder. This includes bundling FFmpeg binaries, configuring production paths, building DMG installer, and ensuring the packaged app works exactly like the development version.

### Why It Matters
Packaging is the **final validation** that all features work in production. A packaged app must work without dev dependencies, Node.js, or manual configuration. If packaging fails, the entire MVP fails. This is a CRITICAL checkpoint that must be tested on Day 2 (not Day 3) to allow time for fixes.

### Success in One Sentence
"This PR is successful when I can double-click the DMG file on a clean Mac, install ClipForge, launch it, import a video, play it, trim it, and export it successfully."

## Technical Design

### Architecture Decisions

#### Decision 1: Packaging Tool
**Options Considered:**
1. **Option A:** `electron-builder` (all-in-one solution)
   - Pros: Comprehensive, handles signing, updates, all platforms
   - Cons: Can be complex for first-time use

2. **Option B:** `electron-packager` (basic bundler)
   - Pros: Simple, straightforward
   - Cons: Manual signing, no auto-updates, limited customization

**Chosen:** Option A - `electron-builder`

**Rationale:**
- Already included in dependencies
- Handles code signing automatically
- Generates DMG installer
- Well-documented and widely used
- Can add auto-updates later
- Professional output

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ Gain: Professional installer, code signing, future-proof
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Lose: Slightly more complex than packager

#### Decision 2: FFmpeg Binary Distribution
**Options Considered:**
1. **Option A:** Include binaries in app bundle (~60MB extra)
   - Pros: Works everywhere, no dependencies
   - Cons: Large app size

2. **Option B:** Require user to install FFmpeg separately
   - Pros: Smaller app bundle
   - Cons: Poor UX, installation friction

**Chosen:** Option A - Bundle FFmpeg binaries

**Rationale:**
- Better user experience (works out of box)
- No installation instructions needed
- Reliable in packaged app
- Worth the file size for MVP
- Users expect video editors to be self-contained

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ Gain: Professional UX, zero setup
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Lose: ~60MB larger app (acceptable for video editor)

#### Decision 3: Code Signing
**Options Considered:**
1. **Option A:** Sign with Apple certificate ($99/year)
   - Pros: No Gatekeeper warnings, trusted
   - Cons: Cost, requires developer account

2. **Option B:** Skip signing (unsigned)
   - Pros: Free, no account needed
   - Cons: Gatekeeper warnings, looks unprofessional

3. **Option C:** Ad-hoc signing (free, temporary)
   - Pros: No warnings on this Mac
   - Cons: Only works for this Mac

**Chosen:** Option B - Unsigned for MVP

**Rationale:**
- MVP deadline doesn't justify $99 certificate
- Users can right-click ‚Üí Open to bypass warning
- Document the bypass in README
- Can upgrade to signed later

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Gain: Free, fast to ship
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Lose: Gatekeeper warning, user friction

#### Decision 4: Production Path Resolution
**Options Considered:**
1. **Option A:** Hardcode paths for production
   - Pros: Simple
   - Cons: Breaks if moved

2. **Option B:** Use `app.getPath()` and detect environment
   - Pros: Works in dev and production
   - Cons: Slightly more complex

**Chosen:** Option B - Smart path resolution

**Rationale:**
- Works in both dev and production
- More robust
- Standard Electron practice
- Future-proof

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ Gain: Works everywhere, maintainable
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Lose: Slightly more code

### Code Examples

**Example 1: electron-builder.yml Configuration**
```yaml
appId: com.clipforge.app
productName: ClipForge

mac:
  target:
    - dmg
  icon: public/icon.png
  category: public.app-category.utilities
  
files:
  - "dist/**/*"
  - "main.js"
  - "preload.js"
  - "electron/**/*"
  - "!electron/ffmpeg/videoProcessing.js.map"

extraResources:
  - from: "node_modules/ffmpeg-static/ffmpeg"
    to: "ffmpeg"
  - from: "node_modules/ffprobe-static/ffprobe"
    to: "ffprobe"

dmg:
  contents:
    - x: 110
      y: 150
    - x: 240
      y: 150
      type: link
      path: /Applications
```

**Example 2: Production Path Detection in main.js**
```javascript
const path = require('path');
const fs = require('fs');
const { app } = require('electron');

// Determine if running in development or production
const isDev = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' || !app.isPackaged;

// Get FFmpeg binary paths
function getFFmpegPaths() {
  if (isDev) {
    // Development: use node_modules
    const ffmpegPath = path.join(__dirname, 'node_modules', 'ffmpeg-static', 'ffmpeg');
    const ffprobePath = path.join(__dirname, 'node_modules', 'ffprobe-static', 'ffprobe');
    return { ffmpegPath, ffprobePath };
  } else {
    // Production: use bundled binaries
    const resourcesPath = process.resourcesPath;
    const ffmpegPath = path.join(resourcesPath, 'ffmpeg');
    const ffprobePath = path.join(resourcesPath, 'ffprobe');
    return { ffmpegPath, ffprobePath };
  }
}
```

**Example 3: Smart Path Resolution in videoProcessing.js**
```javascript
const ffmpeg = require('fluent-ffmpeg');
const path = require('path');
const { app } = require('electron');

function getFFmpegPaths() {
  const isDev = !app || !app.isPackaged;
  
  if (isDev) {
    const ffmpegStatic = require('ffmpeg-static');
    const ffprobeStatic = require('ffprobe-static');
    return {
      ffmpeg: ffmpegStatic,
      ffprobe: ffprobeStatic
    };
  } else {
    // Production paths
    const resourcesPath = process.resourcesPath;
    return {
      ffmpeg: path.join(resourcesPath, 'ffmpeg'),
      ffprobe: path.join(resourcesPath, 'ffprobe')
    };
  }
}

// Export video function with smart paths
function exportVideo(inputPath, outputPath, options = {}) {
  const paths = getFFmpegPaths();
  
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    ffmpeg(inputPath)
      .setFfmpegPath(paths.ffmpeg)
      .setFfprobePath(paths.ffprobe)
      .output(outputPath)
      .on('end', () => resolve(outputPath))
      .on('error', reject)
      .run();
  });
}
```
