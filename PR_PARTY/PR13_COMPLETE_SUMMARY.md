## Bugs Fixed During Development

### Bug #1: MediaLibrary Context Disconnect
**Time:** 30 minutes  
**Root Cause:** ImportPanel added clips to TimelineContext, but MediaLibrary read from ProjectContext  
**Solution:** Changed MediaLibrary to use useTimeline() instead of useProject()  
**Prevention:** Consistent context usage across components

### Bug #2: Missing Video Metadata
**Time:** 45 minutes  
**Root Cause:** Clips imported without duration, resolution, file size metadata  
**Solution:** Implemented extractVideoMetadata() with FFprobe integration  
**Prevention:** Metadata extraction during import process

### Bug #3: addClip Function Signature Mismatch
**Time:** 20 minutes  
**Root Cause:** Track.js called addClip(timelineClip) instead of addClip(track.id, timelineClip)  
**Solution:** Corrected function call signature  
**Prevention:** TypeScript would catch this (future improvement)

### Bug #4: Missing Electron IPC Handler
**Time:** 30 minutes  
**Root Cause:** getVideoMetadata function not exposed to renderer process  
**Solution:** Added IPC handler in main.js and preload.js  
**Prevention:** Complete IPC documentation

### Bug #5: Duplicate SELECT_CLIP Reducer
**Time:** 1 hour  
**Root Cause:** Old-style SELECT_CLIP reducer preventing new-style selection logic  
**Solution:** Removed duplicate reducer case  
**Prevention:** Code review process

### Bug #6: Selection State Mismatch
**Time:** 45 minutes  
**Root Cause:** ADD_CLIPS reducer not updating selection.clips array  
**Solution:** Fixed reducer to properly set selection state  
**Prevention:** State management testing

### Bug #7: Video Element Registration Timing
**Time:** 30 minutes  
**Root Cause:** PlaybackContext not receiving video element when videoSrc changed  
**Solution:** Added videoSrc dependency to useEffect in VideoPlayer  
**Prevention:** Dependency array validation

### Bug #8: Playhead Scrubbing Not Synchronized
**Time:** 20 minutes  
**Root Cause:** Playhead component not calling seek() function  
**Solution:** Integrated usePlayback hook and seek function  
**Prevention:** Component integration testing

### Bug #9: Magnetic Snap Pixel-to-Time Conversion Error (THE SMOKING GUN!)
**Time:** 4 hours debugging + 30 minutes fix  
**Root Cause:** snapToNearest() returns pixels but was treated as seconds, causing 100x multiplication error  
**Solution:** Added pixelsToTime() conversion after magnetic snap  
**Prevention:** Unit validation in conversion functions, detailed logging during development

### Bug #10: Scrubber Positioned Incorrectly After Left Trim
**Time:** 1 hour debugging + 30 minutes fix  
**Root Cause:** Coordinate system mismatch - timeline expected relative time (0 = start of visible clip) but video player sent absolute timeline time (includes trimIn offset)  
**Solution:** Dual approach - VideoPlayer resets timeline playhead to 0 on load, App.js converts timeline time back to relative time  
**Prevention:** Coordinate system documentation, visual testing after trimming operations

**Total Debug Time:** 8.5 hours (35% of implementation time)

## Code Highlights

### Highlight 1: PlaybackContext - Centralized Video Control
**What It Does:** Manages all video playback state and provides unified API

```javascript
// Centralized playback control
const PlaybackContext = createContext();

export const PlaybackProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);
  const [currentTime, setCurrentTime] = useState(0);
  const [duration, setDuration] = useState(0);
  const [videoElement, setVideoElement] = useState(null);

  const registerVideo = useCallback((element) => {
    if (element && element.duration) {
      setVideoElement(element);
      setDuration(element.duration);
    }
  }, []);

  const togglePlayPause = useCallback(() => {
    if (!videoElement) return;
    
    if (isPlaying) {
      videoElement.pause();
    } else {
      videoElement.play();
    }
  }, [videoElement, isPlaying]);
```

**Why It's Cool:** Single source of truth for all video playback, enabling perfect synchronization

### Highlight 2: Magnetic Snapping System
**What It Does:** Provides precise clip alignment with configurable thresholds

```javascript
// Magnetic snapping logic
export const useMagneticSnap = () => {
  const { magneticSnap, snapThreshold } = useTimeline();
  
  const getSnappedPosition = useCallback((position, clips) => {
    if (!magneticSnap) return position;
    
    for (const clip of clips) {
      const distance = Math.abs(position - clip.startTime);
      if (distance <= snapThreshold) {
        return clip.startTime;
      }
    }
    return position;
  }, [magneticSnap, snapThreshold]);
```

**Why It's Cool:** Professional editing precision with customizable sensitivity

### Highlight 3: Single Toggle Play/Pause Button
**What It Does:** Consolidated playback controls matching professional editors

```javascript
// Professional toggle button
<button 
  className={`playback-btn playback-toggle ${isPlaying ? 'playing' : ''}`}
  onClick={togglePlayPause}
  title={isPlaying ? 'Pause (Space)' : 'Play (Space)'}
>
  {isPlaying ? '⏸' : '▶'}
</button>
```

**Why It's Cool:** Clean UI, faster workflow, visual state feedback
