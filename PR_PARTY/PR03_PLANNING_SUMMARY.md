---

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Use Native HTML5 `<video>` Element

**Options Considered:**
1. ✅ Native HTML5 (Chosen)
2. Video.js
3. Plyr
4. React Player

**Rationale:**
- Simplest implementation for MVP needs
- No additional dependencies
- Fast development time (fits 72-hour constraint)
- Can upgrade later if needed

**Impact:** Minimal bundle size, fast implementation, sufficient for MVP

---

### Decision 2: Hybrid State Management Pattern

**Options Considered:**
1. Controlled component
2. Uncontrolled component
3. ✅ Hybrid (Chosen)

**Rationale:**
- UI state (isPlaying) lives in component
- Business state (selectedClip) lives in App
- Reduces prop drilling
- Better performance

**Impact:** Cleaner code, better performance, easier to maintain

---

### Decision 3: Use file:// Protocol for Video Source

**Options Considered:**
1. ✅ file:// protocol (Chosen)
2. Blob URL
3. Local server streaming

**Rationale:**
- Standard Electron pattern
- No memory overhead for large files
- No additional infrastructure needed

**Impact:** Simple implementation, efficient memory usage

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Timeline

**Hour 1: Foundation**
- Create component structure
- Add state management
- Implement empty state
- **Checkpoint:** Component renders

**Hour 2: Core Functionality**
- Render video element
- Implement play/pause
- Add time display
- **Checkpoint:** Can play/pause video

**Hour 3: Polish**
- Add styling
- Loading/error states
- Integration with App
- **Checkpoint:** Fully integrated

**Hour 4: Testing**
- Edge cases
- Performance testing
- Bug fixes
- **Checkpoint:** Complete ✅

### Key Principle

**"Get it working, then make it beautiful."**

Focus on core functionality first:
1. Video element renders ✅
2. Play button works ✅
3. Pause button works ✅

Then add polish:
- Time display
- Loading states
- Error handling
- Styling

---

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- [ ] Play button works
- [ ] Pause button works
- [ ] Time displays correctly
- [ ] Video switches smoothly
- [ ] Zero console errors

### Qualitative
- [ ] User can play/pause video
- [ ] Loading feels responsive
- [ ] Errors are user-friendly
- [ ] UI is visually appealing

---

## Risks Identified & Mitigated

### Risk 1: Video Codec Incompatibility 🟡 MEDIUM

**Issue:** Some video files won't play in browser  
**Mitigation:**
- Use H.264 codec for videos
- Test with common formats during development
- Provide error messages for unsupported codecs

**Status:** Addressed with codec requirement ✅

---

### Risk 2: File Path Issues in Electron 🟢 LOW

**Issue:** file:// protocol paths incorrect  
**Mitigation:**
- Use standard Electron file:// pattern
- Test in both dev and production
- Convert absolute paths correctly

**Status:** Standard pattern, low risk ✅

---

### Risk 3: Memory Leaks 🟡 MEDIUM

**Issue:** Video elements not cleaned up properly  
**Mitigation:**
- Proper cleanup in useEffect
- Clear video.src on unmount
- Test with multiple video switches
- Monitor memory in dev tools

**Status:** Standard React pattern ✅

**Overall Risk:** 🟢 LOW - Standard patterns, well-documented

---

## Hot Tips

### Tip 1: Use useRef for Video Element

**Why:** Direct DOM access needed for play()/pause() methods

```javascript
const videoRef = useRef(null);
const video = videoRef.current;
video.play();  // Direct DOM manipulation
```

---

### Tip 2: Catch play() Promise

**Why:** play() can fail and throw an error

```javascript
video.play().catch((err) => {
  console.error('Play error:', err);
  setError('Failed to play video');
});
```

---

### Tip 3: Reset State When Video Source Changes

**Why:** Avoid stale state from previous video

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!videoSrc) {
    setCurrentTime(0);
    setDuration(0);
    setIsPlaying(false);
    setError(null);
  }
}, [videoSrc]);
```

---

### Tip 4: Format Time Carefully

**Why:** NaN values break display

```javascript
const formatTime = (seconds) => {
  if (!seconds || isNaN(seconds)) return '00:00';  // Guard clause
  // Format logic
};
```

## Go / No-Go Decision

### Go If:
- ✅ PR #2 (File Import) is complete
- ✅ You have 3+ hours available
- ✅ Comfortable with React hooks
- ✅ Have test video files ready

### No-Go If:
- ❌ PR #2 not complete yet
- ❌ Less than 2 hours available
- ❌ Not familiar with HTML5 video API
- ❌ No test videos available

**Decision Aid:** If you have the time and PR #2 is done, start immediately. This is a critical path feature.

**Current Status:** 🟢 GO - Ready to implement

---

## Immediate Next Actions

### Pre-Flight (5 minutes)

- [ ] Verify PR #2 complete
- [ ] Check branch is created: `feat/video-player`
- [ ] Have test video file ready (MP4, H.264)

### Hour 1 Goals (3-4 tasks)

- [ ] Create `src/components/VideoPlayer.js`
- [ ] Add state variables and event handlers
- [ ] Implement empty state
- [ ] Test component renders in App

**Checkpoint:** Empty state displays when no video selected

---

## Conclusion

**Planning Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Confidence Level:** HIGH  
**Recommendation:** Build it! This is a straightforward feature using proven patterns.

**Key Strengths:**
- Standard HTML5 video element (no custom implementation)
- Clear separation of concerns (UI vs business state)
- Well-documented implementation steps
- Low complexity, high value

**Key Considerations:**
- Test early with actual video files
- Monitor memory usage during development
- Keep it simple for MVP (play/pause is sufficient)

**Next Step:** When PR #2 is complete, start Phase 1 immediately.

---

**You've got this!** 💪

Video playback is a core feature that makes the app feel real. HTML5 video makes it straightforward—you're not building from scratch, you're orchestrating a proven API.

The implementation checklist breaks everything into clear steps. Follow it, commit often, and you'll have a working player in 3-4 hours.

*"Ship the features that users will notice. A working player with play/pause > a beautiful player that doesn't work."*
