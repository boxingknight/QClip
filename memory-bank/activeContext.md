## Active Considerations

### Technical Decisions Pending
1. **React vs Vue vs Svelte** - Decision: React (already made in PRD)
2. **Timeline UI approach** - Decision: Custom CSS/DOM for MVP
3. **Trim UI pattern** - Decision: Button-based (set current time as in/out point)

### Open Questions
1. **macOS first or Windows?** - Decision: macOS (if developing on Mac)
2. **Should we test on both platforms?** - Decision: Focus on one for MVP
3. **Progress indicator during export?** - Decision: Basic text is fine for MVP

## Immediate Next Steps

### Before Starting PR #1
- [ ] Review project structure decision
- [ ] Confirm development machine has Node.js 18+
- [ ] Clear morning schedule for Day 1 work

### PR #1 Tasks (4 hours)
- [ ] Initialize Git repository
- [ ] Create package.json with dependencies
- [ ] Install Electron + React dependencies
- [ ] Create Webpack configuration
- [ ] Create Electron main.js
- [ ] Create preload.js
- [ ] Create basic React app
- [ ] Configure Electron Builder
- [ ] Test app launches in dev mode

### Critical Path Awareness
**High-Risk Items (Test Early):**
1. FFmpeg export functionality ‚Üí Test on Day 1
2. Video playback in Electron renderer ‚Üí Test on Day 1
3. File import and validation ‚Üí Test on Day 1
4. Building and packaging the app ‚Üí Test on Day 2, not Day 3

**Time Management Rule:** If export doesn't work by end of Day 1, pivot immediately.
