## Active Considerations

### V2 Technical Decisions Made
1. **State Management** - Context API (not Redux/Zustand) for scalability
2. **Timeline Architecture** - Multi-track with drag-drop and split functionality
3. **Recording Pipeline** - MediaRecorder + desktopCapturer APIs
4. **Project Files** - JSON-based .clipforge format for save/load
5. **FFmpeg Integration** - Multi-track rendering with complex filter chains

### V2 Open Questions
1. **Recording First or Timeline First?** - Decision: Timeline first (foundation)
2. **Multi-Track Complexity** - Start with 2 tracks or go to 3+? Decision: Start with 2
3. **Effects Scope** - How many transitions initially? Decision: 2-3 (fade, wipe, slide)
4. **Cloud Integration** - Which services first? Decision: Google Drive first

## Immediate Next Steps

### Before Starting V2 Development
- [ ] Review V2 PRD and task list thoroughly
- [ ] Set up V2 development branch from MVP
- [ ] Confirm development environment is ready
- [ ] Plan first week's work schedule

### PR #11 Tasks (State Management Refactor)
- [ ] Create TimelineContext with multi-track state
- [ ] Create ProjectContext for save/load functionality
- [ ] Create UIContext for modals and toasts
- [ ] Refactor existing components to use Context API
- [ ] Update Timeline component for multi-track preparation
- [ ] Test all existing MVP features still work

### Critical Path Awareness
**High-Risk Items (Test Early):**
1. Context API state management ‚Üí Test on Day 1
2. Multi-track timeline rendering ‚Üí Test in PR #13
3. Recording performance ‚Üí Test in PR #17
4. Multi-track FFmpeg rendering ‚Üí Test in PR #23

**Time Management Rule:** If state management refactor breaks MVP functionality, fix immediately before proceeding.
