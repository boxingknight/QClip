## What We're Working On Right Now

### 🎯 Current Focus: V2 Development - PR#14 COMPLETE!

**Status:** ✅ PR#14 Drag & Drop Clips COMPLETE & DEPLOYED  
**Next Action:** Begin PR#15 Split & Delete Clips Planning  
**Priority:** Core editing interaction  
**Time Taken:** 4-6 hours (as estimated)

**PR#14 Implementation Completed Successfully:**
1. ✅ Converted Clip component from mouse events to HTML5 drag & drop
2. ✅ Enhanced Track drop handler for both Media Library and Timeline clips
3. ✅ Created dragDropCalculations.js utilities (snap & validation)
4. ✅ Implemented time-based snap-to-clip (2.0s primary, 5.0s gap-closing)
5. ✅ Added origin (time 0) snapping for timeline organization
6. ✅ Gap-closing logic for automatic clip organization
7. ✅ Visual snap indicators (SnapLine component)
8. ✅ Enhanced drag feedback with smooth animations
9. ✅ Preserved Media Library drag & drop (fully functional)
10. ✅ Preserved clip trimming functionality (mouse events for precision)

**Bugs Fixed:**
- 🔧 ReferenceError: snapTarget undefined (console.log bug)
- 🔧 Origin snapping not working (added origin as snap target)
- 🔧 Snap calculation parameter order (fixed dropTime vs draggedClip.startTime)
- 🔧 Gaps between clips (increased thresholds, added gap-closing)

**PR#13 Completed Successfully:**
1. ✅ Professional multi-track timeline with video, audio, and text tracks
2. ✅ CapCut-style visual design with modern colors and spacing
3. ✅ Magnetic snapping system for precise clip alignment
4. ✅ Professional zoom controls (fit to content, reset zoom)
5. ✅ Centralized PlaybackContext for video control
6. ✅ Single toggle Play/Pause button (turns blue when playing)
7. ✅ Timeline playhead scrubbing with video synchronization
8. ✅ Enhanced Media Library with drag-and-drop functionality
9. ✅ Complete metadata display (duration, resolution, file size, codec)
10. ✅ Professional UI/UX matching industry standards

**Bugs Fixed During Implementation:**
- 🔧 MediaLibrary context disconnect (TimelineContext vs ProjectContext)
- 🔧 Missing video metadata extraction (FFprobe integration)
- 🔧 addClip function signature mismatch
- 🔧 Missing Electron IPC handler for getVideoMetadata
- 🔧 Duplicate SELECT_CLIP reducer preventing selection
- 🔧 Selection state mismatch in ADD_CLIPS reducer
- 🔧 Video element registration timing issues
- 🔧 Playhead scrubbing not synchronized with video
- 🔧 **CRITICAL: Magnetic snap pixel-to-time conversion error** (100x multiplication bug!)

**Technical Achievements:**
- Professional video editor architecture with React Context API
- Bidirectional video synchronization between timeline and player
- Magnetic timeline system with configurable thresholds
- CapCut-style UI/UX with hover effects and transitions
- Single toggle playback controls (industry standard)

**Next Steps:**
1. 📋 Plan PR#15 - Split & Delete Clips
2. 📋 Continue V2 advanced timeline features
3. 📋 Update all documentation (in progress)

**Expected Outcome:** Professional video editor that rivals CapCut and Premiere Pro

## Active Considerations

### V2 Technical Decisions Made
1. **State Management** - Context API (not Redux/Zustand) for scalability
2. **Timeline Architecture** - Multi-track with drag-drop and split functionality
3. **Recording Pipeline** - MediaRecorder + desktopCapturer APIs
4. **Project Files** - JSON-based .clipforge format for save/load
5. **FFmpeg Integration** - Multi-track rendering with complex filter chains

### V2 Open Questions
1. **Recording First or Timeline First?** - Decision: Timeline first (foundation)
2. **Multi-Track Complexity** - Start with 2 tracks or go to 3+? Decision: Start with 2
3. **Effects Scope** - How many transitions initially? Decision: 2-3 (fade, wipe, slide)
4. **Cloud Integration** - Which services first? Decision: Google Drive first

## Immediate Next Steps

### Before Starting V2 Development
- [ ] Review V2 PRD and task list thoroughly
- [ ] Set up V2 development branch from MVP
- [ ] Confirm development environment is ready
- [ ] Plan first week's work schedule

### PR #11 Tasks (State Management Refactor)
- [ ] Create TimelineContext with multi-track state
- [ ] Create ProjectContext for save/load functionality
- [ ] Create UIContext for modals and toasts
- [ ] Refactor existing components to use Context API
- [ ] Update Timeline component for multi-track preparation
- [ ] Test all existing MVP features still work

### Critical Path Awareness
**High-Risk Items (Test Early):**
1. Context API state management → Test on Day 1
2. Multi-track timeline rendering → Test in PR #13
3. Recording performance → Test in PR #17
4. Multi-track FFmpeg rendering → Test in PR #23

**Time Management Rule:** If state management refactor breaks MVP functionality, fix immediately before proceeding.
