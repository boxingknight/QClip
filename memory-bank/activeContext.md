## Active Considerations

### Technical Decisions Pending
1. **React vs Vue vs Svelte** - Decision: React (already made in PRD)
2. **Timeline UI approach** - Decision: Custom CSS/DOM for MVP
3. **Trim UI pattern** - Decision: Button-based (set current time as in/out point)

### Open Questions
1. **macOS first or Windows?** - Decision: macOS (if developing on Mac)
2. **Should we test on both platforms?** - Decision: Focus on one for MVP
3. **Progress indicator during export?** - Decision: Basic text is fine for MVP
