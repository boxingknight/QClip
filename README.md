## Architecture Overview

ClipForge is built with a modern desktop application architecture:

### Core Technologies
- **Electron** - Desktop framework providing native OS integration
- **React** - UI framework for component-based interface
- **FFmpeg** - Video processing engine for export functionality
- **Webpack** - Module bundler for React application

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"App is damaged" warning on macOS:**
- Right-click the app → Open
- Click "Open" in the dialog
- This is normal for unsigned apps

**FFmpeg not found error:**
- Ensure you're using the packaged app (not dev mode)
- FFmpeg binaries are bundled with the packaged app
- Try reinstalling the app

**Video won't play:**
- Check file format (MP4/MOV supported)
- Ensure file isn't corrupted
- Try a different video file

**Export fails:**
- Check available disk space
- Ensure output directory is writable
- Try a shorter video clip first

**App crashes:**
- Check console for error messages
- Try restarting the app
- Report issue with error details

### Performance Tips
- Use shorter video clips for faster processing
- Close other applications during export
- Ensure adequate RAM (4GB+ recommended)
