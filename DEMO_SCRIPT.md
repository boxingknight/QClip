## Demo Script

### Introduction (0:00 - 0:30)

**[Narrator/Text]:** "Welcome to ClipForge, a professional desktop video editor built in 72 hours as an MVP demonstration. ClipForge provides a complete video editing pipeline from import to export, with timeline-based trimming and professional dark mode interface."

**[Visual]:** Show ClipForge app icon, then launch the application

**[Narrator/Text]:** "Let's explore ClipForge's key features: video import, playback, timeline visualization, trimming, and export."

### Feature 1: Video Import (0:30 - 1:00)

**[Narrator/Text]:** "First, let's import some video files. ClipForge supports MP4 and MOV formats."

**[Action]:** Click "Browse Files" button

**[Narrator/Text]:** "I'll select a few sample videos to demonstrate the multi-clip functionality."

**[Action]:** Select 2-3 video files from file dialog

**[Visual]:** Show imported clips appearing in the interface with file sizes

**[Narrator/Text]:** "Notice how ClipForge displays each imported clip with file size information and creates a visual timeline representation."

### Feature 2: Video Playback (1:00 - 1:30)

**[Narrator/Text]:** "Now let's play one of our imported videos. Click on any clip to select it."

**[Action]:** Click on first imported clip

**[Narrator/Text]:** "The video player shows the selected clip with professional controls."

**[Action]:** Click play button

**[Narrator/Text]:** "You can see the video playing with synchronized audio, current time display, and total duration. The timeline shows our position within the clip."

**[Action]:** Pause video, scrub to different position

**[Narrator/Text]:** "You can scrub through the video by clicking anywhere on the timeline."

### Feature 3: Timeline Visualization (1:30 - 2:00)

**[Narrator/Text]:** "The timeline is the heart of ClipForge. It shows all imported clips with proportional widths based on their duration."

**[Action]:** Click on different clips to show selection

**[Narrator/Text]:** "Each clip is clickable for selection, and the timeline provides a visual overview of your entire project. Notice how longer videos take up more space on the timeline."

**[Action]:** Show multiple clips selected

**[Narrator/Text]:** "ClipForge supports multiple clips, which can be exported as a single concatenated video."

### Feature 4: Timeline-Based Trimming (2:00 - 3:00)

**[Narrator/Text]:** "Now let's demonstrate ClipForge's trimming functionality. This is where ClipForge becomes a true video editor."

**[Action]:** Select a clip, play it briefly

**[Narrator/Text]:** "To trim a clip, simply double-click on the timeline where you want to set the start point."

**[Action]:** Double-click on timeline at desired start point

**[Narrator/Text]:** "You can see the trim indicator appears with a green highlight. Now let's set the end point."

**[Action]:** Double-click again to set end point

**[Narrator/Text]:** "Perfect! The trim region is now defined. You can also drag the handles to fine-tune your trim points."

**[Action]:** Drag trim handles to adjust

**[Narrator/Text]:** "When you're satisfied with your trim points, click 'Apply Trim' to render the trimmed version."

**[Action]:** Click "Apply Trim" button

**[Narrator/Text]:** "ClipForge processes the trim using FFmpeg and updates the clip to use the trimmed version. You can see the progress indicator during processing."

### Feature 5: Video Export (3:00 - 4:00)

**[Narrator/Text]:** "Finally, let's export our edited video. Click 'Export Video' to save your work."

**[Action]:** Click "Export Video" button

**[Narrator/Text]:** "ClipForge opens a native save dialog where you can choose the output location and filename."

**[Action]:** Select save location and filename

**[Narrator/Text]:** "The export process shows real-time progress and uses FFmpeg for high-quality MP4 encoding."

**[Visual]:** Show progress bar during export

**[Narrator/Text]:** "Export complete! ClipForge has successfully created your edited video file."

**[Action]:** Show success message

### Feature 6: Multi-Clip Export (4:00 - 4:30)

**[Narrator/Text]:** "Each clip can have its own trim points, and ClipForge will concatenate them in timeline order."
